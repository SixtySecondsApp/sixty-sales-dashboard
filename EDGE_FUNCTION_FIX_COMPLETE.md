# Edge Function Fix Complete

## Issue Resolved

Fixed the PostgreSQL foreign key relationship error that was preventing AI suggestions from being created.

## Error Details

**Error Message**:
```
Could not find a relationship between 'meetings' and 'contacts' in the schema cache
Searched for a foreign key relationship using hint 'fk_meetings_primary_contact_id'
```

**Root Cause**: Edge Function query used incorrect foreign key constraint name

**Location**: `supabase/functions/suggest-next-actions/index.ts` line 201

## Fix Applied

### Before (BROKEN):
```typescript
contacts:contacts!fk_meetings_primary_contact_id(id, name, email, role)
```

### After (FIXED):
```typescript
contacts:contacts!primary_contact_id(id, name, email, role)
```

**Explanation**:
- The `meetings` table has inline foreign key: `primary_contact_id UUID REFERENCES contacts(id)`
- No named constraint `fk_meetings_primary_contact_id` exists
- Using column name `primary_contact_id` allows PostgREST to auto-detect the relationship

## Deployment Status

✅ **Edge Function Deployed**: `suggest-next-actions` deployed to Supabase
- Deployment time: Just now
- Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb/functions

## Testing Next Step

Run this SQL to test the fix:

```sql
-- Test with one meeting
SELECT
  m.id,
  m.title,
  regenerate_next_actions_for_activity(m.id, 'meeting') as result
FROM meetings m
WHERE m.transcript_text IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 1;
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "request_id": <number>,
  "message": "Suggestion generation queued"
}
```

Then check for created suggestions:
```sql
SELECT
  count(*) as total_suggestions,
  count(DISTINCT meeting_id) as meetings_with_suggestions
FROM next_action_suggestions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes';
```

**Expected**: Should see suggestions created for the test meeting

## Complete Fix Timeline

1. ✅ **pg_net extension enabled** (via Dashboard)
2. ✅ **system_config table created** (migration 20251031000003)
3. ✅ **Configuration values set** (supabase_url + service_role_key)
4. ✅ **Function signature fixed** (correct pg_net.http_post parameters)
5. ✅ **Async return handling** (return request_id, not response)
6. ✅ **Foreign key relationship fixed** (this deployment)

## What's Working Now

- ✅ Database triggers can call Edge Functions via pg_net
- ✅ HTTP requests are queued successfully
- ✅ Edge Function receives requests
- ✅ Edge Function can fetch meeting data with relationships
- ⏳ AI suggestions should now be created (needs verification)

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/andrewbryce/Documents/sixty-sales-dashboard/supabase/functions/suggest-next-actions/index.ts`
   - Line 201: Fixed foreign key hint from `!fk_meetings_primary_contact_id` to `!primary_contact_id`

## Next Actions

1. **Test the fix**: Run the test SQL above
2. **Verify suggestions created**: Check database for new suggestions
3. **Check UI**: Verify AI Suggestions badges appear in meetings
4. **Monitor logs**: Watch Edge Function logs for any new errors
5. **Test automatic triggers**: Update a meeting transcript to trigger automatic generation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Test SQL executes without errors
- [ ] Suggestions created in database
- [ ] Edge Function logs show successful execution
- [ ] AI Suggestions badges visible in UI
- [ ] Automatic trigger works when transcript updated
