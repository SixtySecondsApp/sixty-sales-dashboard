## Tips and Best Practices

### 📌 Before Extracting Topics

**1. Review Your Transcript**
- Skim meeting transcript first
- Verify transcript quality (AI transcription isn't perfect)
- Note any sensitive information that shouldn't be public

**2. Check Meeting Length**
- Meetings <10 minutes: May not have enough content for topics
- Meetings 30-60 minutes: Ideal length (5-10 topics)
- Meetings >90 minutes: May generate too many topics (filter carefully)

**3. Consider Your Audience**
- Internal vs. external content
- Technical vs. non-technical audience
- Promotional vs. educational intent

### ✅ Topic Selection Best Practices

**1. Quality Over Quantity**
- Don't select all topics just because they exist
- Choose topics that support your narrative
- 3-5 topics usually provides best content flow

**2. Look for Complementary Topics**
- Topics that build on each other
- Create logical progression
- Tell a complete story

**3. Verify Timestamp Links**
- Click timestamp badge to preview
- Ensure topic accurately reflects that moment
- Avoid topics with generic/vague descriptions

### 📝 Content Generation Tips

**1. Match Format to Channel**
- Don't use blog post for Twitter (too long)
- Don't use social post for company blog (too short)
- Consider where content will be published

**2. Plan for Editing**
- AI content is a starting point, not final draft
- Budget 10-15 minutes for polish and personalization
- Add company-specific terminology
- Adjust tone to match brand voice

**3. Maintain Authenticity**
- Review for accuracy (AI sometimes generalizes)
- Add personal anecdotes not in transcript
- Include team member names (if appropriate)
- Verify all facts and claims

### 🔄 Version Management

**1. When to Regenerate**
- First version is too generic
- Tone doesn't match your brand
- Missing key points from selected topics
- Content structure feels off

**2. Version Comparison**
- Save both versions to Google Doc
- Highlight best sections from each
- Combine strongest elements
- Use v1 as rough draft, v2 as refined version

**3. Rate Limit Strategy**
- You have 3 regenerations per day
- Use first generation to understand AI style
- Regenerate if significantly off-target
- Don't waste regenerations on minor tweaks (edit manually)

### 💡 Advanced Workflows

**1. Content Series**
- Extract topics once
- Generate multiple content types from same topics
- Blog post → Social teasers → Email newsletter → Video
- Repurpose across channels

**2. Collaboration**
- Extract topics
- Share topic selection with team (screenshot)
- Get consensus on which topics to feature
- Generate content with team input

**3. Content Calendar Integration**
- Extract topics on Friday
- Generate multiple social posts for next week
- Schedule in social media tool
- Maintain consistent publishing cadence

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No Transcript Available"

**Problem**: Content tab shows "This meeting doesn't have a transcript"

**Causes**:
- Meeting recently synced (transcript processing takes 5-10 minutes)
- Fathom recording didn't include transcript
- Meeting was uploaded manually without transcript

**Solutions**:
1. Wait 10 minutes after meeting ends
2. Refresh browser page
3. Check Fathom to verify transcript exists
4. Re-sync meeting if necessary

---

### "Extract Topics" Button Not Working

**Problem**: Button click doesn't start extraction

**Causes**:
- Network connectivity issue
- Authentication token expired
- Meeting doesn't have transcript
- Server temporarily unavailable

**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Refresh page (login may have expired)
3. Verify transcript exists
4. Wait 1 minute and try again
5. Clear browser cache

**Still Not Working?**
Contact support with:
- Meeting ID
- Timestamp of attempt
- Browser and OS version
- Screenshot of error (if visible)

---

### Topics Look Generic or Irrelevant

**Problem**: Extracted topics don't match meeting content

**Causes**:
- Transcript quality issues (poor audio, overlapping speech)
- Meeting primarily non-marketing discussion
- AI interpretation didn't match intent

**Solutions**:
1. Click "Re-extract Topics" (AI will analyze again)
2. Review original transcript for accuracy
3. Edit topics manually after generation (future feature)
4. Select different meetings with clearer discussion points

**Best Practice**: Meetings with clear, structured discussions produce better topics.

---

### Generated Content Too Generic

**Problem**: Content lacks specific details from meeting

**Causes**:
- Topic descriptions were vague
- Too many topics selected (AI tries to cover everything shallowly)
- Meeting discussion lacked concrete details

**Solutions**:
1. Regenerate with fewer, more specific topics
2. Manually edit content to add specific details
3. Use inline timestamp links to find exact quotes
4. Combine AI content with manual additions

**Remember**: AI provides structure and flow, you add personality and specifics.

---

### "Rate Limit Exceeded"

**Problem**: Error message when trying to generate content

**Causes**:
- Exceeded 10 content generations per hour
- Exceeded 3 regenerations per day
- System-wide rate limit reached (rare)

**Solutions**:
1. Wait until next hour (10 generations/hour limit)
2. Tomorrow for regenerations (3/day limit)
3. Check when limit resets (shown in error message)
4. Prioritize most important content first

**Why Rate Limits?**
- Prevents accidental cost runaway
- Ensures system availability for all users
- Encourages thoughtful content creation

---

### Copy/Download Not Working

**Problem**: Copy button doesn't copy, or download doesn't start

**Causes**:
- Browser clipboard permissions
- Pop-up blocker preventing download
- Browser extension interference

**Solutions**:

**For Copy Issues**:
1. Click "Copy to Clipboard" again
2. Grant clipboard permission when prompted
3. Manually select text and Ctrl+C / Cmd+C
4. Try different browser

**For Download Issues**:
1. Allow pop-ups for this site
2. Check downloads folder (may have downloaded)
3. Right-click content → "Save As"
4. Disable browser extensions temporarily

---

### Timestamp Links Not Working

**Problem**: Clicking timestamp doesn't open Fathom recording

**Causes**:
- Fathom recording set to private
- You're not logged into Fathom
- Meeting recording deleted
- Timestamp format invalid

**Solutions**:
1. Log into Fathom in another tab first
2. Verify recording still exists in Fathom
3. Check recording privacy settings
4. Contact support if all recordings fail
