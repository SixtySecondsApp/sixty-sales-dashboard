# Proposal Button Page Refresh Fix

## Issue
Clicking "Add a proposal" (or any other quick action button) in the Quick Add modal was causing the page to refresh.

## Root Cause
The quick action buttons (including "Add a proposal") were missing the `type="button"` attribute, causing them to default to `type="submit"`. This could trigger form submission behavior in certain contexts.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added `type="button"` to Quick Action Buttons
- Added `type="button"` to all quick action buttons (Outbound, Meeting, Proposal, etc.)
- This prevents any form submission behavior

### 2. Added Event Prevention
- Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to the click handler
- This provides extra protection against any unwanted page refreshes or event bubbling

### 3. Fixed Close Button
- Also added `type="button"` to the close button in the modal header

## Files Modified
- **src/components/QuickAdd.tsx**
  - Line 320: Added `type="button"` to close button
  - Line 343: Added `type="button"` to quick action buttons
  - Line 356-358: Added `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to click handler

## Testing Instructions
1. Open the Quick Add modal (green + button)
2. Click "Add a proposal"
3. Verify the page does NOT refresh
4. The DealWizard should open smoothly
5. Test all other quick action buttons (Meeting, Outbound, etc.)
6. Verify none of them cause page refreshes

## Expected Behavior
- All quick action buttons should open their respective forms/modals
- No page refreshes should occur
- Transitions should be smooth without any interruptions
- The DealWizard should open when clicking proposal/deal/sale actions

## Prevention for Future
When adding buttons in React:
1. Always specify `type="button"` for non-submit buttons
2. Use `type="submit"` only for actual form submission buttons
3. Add event prevention when needed to stop unwanted behaviors

## Status
âœ… Fixed and ready for testing
