# CRM Transformation Plan
## AI-Powered Sales CRM with Proper Relationship Management

### 🎯 **Primary Goal**
Transform the current sales dashboard into a full CRM with clean, normalized data relationships to eliminate duplication and enable powerful analytics.

---

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**

### ✅ **What We Have**
- `deals` table with basic pipeline functionality
- `activities` table with contact_identifier tracking
- `deal_activities` linking table
- Basic drag-and-drop pipeline interface
- Activity → Deal creation logic (partially implemented)

### ❌ **Current Problems**
- **Data Duplication**: Company names stored as text in deals table
- **Poor Relationships**: No proper contacts/companies tables
- **Inconsistent Matching**: contact_identifier doesn't properly link to structured data
- **Limited Reporting**: Can't aggregate across relationships properly
- **Manual Data Entry**: No auto-assignment of contacts to companies

---

## 🏗️ **Architecture Overview**

### **New Data Model**
```
Companies (1) ←→ (N) Contacts (1) ←→ (N) Deals (1) ←→ (N) Activities
    ↓                    ↓                ↓               ↓
  Domain-based      Email-based     Pipeline-based   Type-based
  auto-matching     auto-matching   auto-creation    auto-linking
```

### **Core Relationships**
1. **Company** ↔ **Contacts** (1:Many)
2. **Contact** ↔ **Deals** (Many:Many via deal_contacts)
3. **Deal** ↔ **Activities** (1:Many)
4. **Company** ↔ **Activities** (1:Many, derived)
