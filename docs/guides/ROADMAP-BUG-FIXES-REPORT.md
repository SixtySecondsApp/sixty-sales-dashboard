## Fixed Bug Tickets

### 1. üîÑ Refresh Pipeline for Suggestions
**ID**: `39b81cbd-1e7f-4325-a21f-b1a617c8c997`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed ‚Üí Testing  

**Problem**: The roadmap page was refreshing unnecessarily when dragging suggestion cards between columns, causing a poor user experience.

**Root Cause**: The component was using a `refreshKey` state that forced a complete re-render of the drag-and-drop context after each move operation.

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed the `refreshKey` state variable from RoadmapKanban component
- Removed the `setTimeout` call that was incrementing the refresh key
- Removed the key prop from DndContext that was causing re-initialization
- The real-time subscription already handles updates, making manual refresh unnecessary

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/roadmap/RoadmapKanban.tsx` - Removed refresh mechanism

### 2. ‚úèÔ∏è Editing Tickets Error
**ID**: `1a3c2a4d-6eb2-451f-871f-c0a2c3008236`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed ‚Üí Testing  

**Problem**: Users were unable to edit tickets and received a 400 error from the Supabase API.

**Root Cause**: The suggestion form was including the `status` field in updates for non-admin users, which they don't have permission to modify.

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified the form submission logic to only include fields that users have permission to update
- Added proper distinction between admin and non-admin field updates
- Improved error handling to show user-friendly error messages

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/roadmap/SuggestionForm.tsx` - Fixed field inclusion logic
- `src/components/roadmap/RoadmapKanban.tsx` - Added better error handling

### 3. üè∑Ô∏è Roadmap Column Name Change
**ID**: `80586fb0-fd32-4e05-83ca-5fc1b5174f55`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed ‚Üí Testing  

**Problem**: Request to change the column name from "Under Review" to "Planned" on the roadmap page.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated the ROADMAP_STATUSES constant to change the display name
- Updated the dropdown option in the suggestion form for consistency
- The internal ID remains `under_review` for backward compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/contexts/RoadmapContext.tsx` - Updated status display name
- `src/components/roadmap/SuggestionForm.tsx` - Updated dropdown label

### 4. üí° Ticket Lightbox Background Coverage
**ID**: `15c89810-f58f-418d-8839-2be16e78ceb8`  
**Priority**: Low  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed ‚Üí Testing  

**Problem**: The modal background overlay wasn't covering the full page, leaving a small gap at the top.

**Root Cause**: The modal was being rendered within a component that might have positioning context issues.

**Solution Applied**:
- Implemented React Portal to render the modal at the document body level
- Increased z-index to ensure it appears above all other content
- Added inline style to ensure margin is 0
- This ensures the overlay covers the entire viewport regardless of parent positioning

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/roadmap/RoadmapKanban.tsx` - Implemented portal rendering
