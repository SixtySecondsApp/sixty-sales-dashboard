# Performance Baseline Metrics - Sixty Sales Dashboard

**Generated**: August 21, 2025  
**Analysis Scope**: Initial load performance, bundle analysis, Core Web Vitals baseline

## Executive Summary

Initial performance analysis reveals significant optimization opportunities across all layers of the application. The dashboard shows characteristics of a complex CRM system with heavy JavaScript dependencies and room for substantial performance improvements.

## Current Performance Baseline

### Frontend Performance Metrics (Development Server)

**Server Configuration**:
- Development server: Vite 5.4.19
- Port: localhost:5176
- Mode: Development with HMR enabled

**Resource Loading Statistics**:
- **Total Resources Loaded**: 74 files
- **Total Transfer Size**: 7.33 MB (7,328,170 bytes)
- **JavaScript Resources**: 28 files
- **CSS Resources**: 1 file
- **Slowest Resource**: performanceMonitor.ts (1,140ms load time)

**Memory Usage (Chrome DevTools)**:
- **Used JS Heap Size**: 22.4 MB
- **Total JS Heap Size**: 23.5 MB
- **JS Heap Size Limit**: 4.29 GB
- **Memory Efficiency**: Good (minimal heap pressure)

### Bundle Composition Analysis

**Key Dependencies Identified** (from package.json):
- **React Ecosystem**: react, react-dom, react-router-dom
- **UI Libraries**: @radix-ui components (14 packages)
- **Data Management**: @tanstack/react-query, zustand
- **Visualization**: recharts, framer-motion
- **Backend**: @supabase/supabase-js
- **Utilities**: date-fns, lucide-react, clsx, tailwind-merge

**Optimization Opportunities Identified**:
1. **Heavy Dependencies**: Recharts (chart library) - potential for tree shaking
2. **Animation Library**: Framer Motion - consider lighter alternatives for simple animations
3. **Icon Library**: Lucide React - import issues suggest version mismatch
4. **Date Library**: date-fns - consider lighter alternatives
5. **UI Components**: Multiple Radix UI packages - bundle splitting potential

### Network Performance Analysis

**Development Server Performance**:
- All resources served from localhost with instant response
- HTTP/1.1 protocol used for all requests
- No compression applied (development mode)
- No CDN or caching headers

**Critical Path Analysis**:
1. Initial HTML served (~200ms)
2. Main React bundle loads
3. Component-specific chunks load dynamically
4. API connections established to backend

### Database Performance Context

**Backend API Status**: Running with connection pool monitoring
- Database: PostgreSQL (Neon.tech)
- Connection errors observed: 4 connection terminations
- Pool utilization: Moderate (1-2 active connections)
- Query caching: Some hits observed (30 hits, 8 misses)

## Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Bundle Size Concerns
**Impact**: High - Affects initial load time
- 7.33MB total transfer size in development
- Multiple heavy dependencies
- No evidence of tree shaking optimization
- Production bundle size unknown (build fails due to import issues)

### 2. Icon Import Issues
**Impact**: Medium - Prevents production builds
- HandshakeIcon, HandHeart imports fail from lucide-react
- Suggests version compatibility issues
- Blocks bundle analysis and optimization

### 3. Database Connection Stability
**Impact**: High - Affects runtime performance
- Connection termination errors observed
- Pool management working but with errors
- Potential impact on API response times

### 4. Development vs Production Gap
**Impact**: High - Unknown production performance
- Build failures prevent accurate bundle analysis
- Development metrics may not reflect production reality
- Need production build for accurate Lighthouse audit

## Recommended Immediate Actions

### Phase 1: Build Stabilization (Priority: Critical)
1. **Fix Import Issues**
   - Resolve lucide-react icon imports
   - Update to compatible versions
   - Enable production builds

2. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Generate production build
   - Analyze chunk sizes
   - Identify optimization targets

### Phase 2: Performance Optimization (Priority: High)
1. **Bundle Size Reduction**
   - Implement tree shaking
   - Code splitting by route
   - Dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Target: 50% bundle size reduction

2. **Database Optimization**
   - Fix connection pool issues
   - Implement query optimization
   - Add response caching
   - Target: 300ms API response time

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Priority: Medium)
1. **Frontend Performance**
   - Component memoization
   - Virtual scrolling for large lists
   - Image optimization
   - Target: <3s initial load time

2. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Performance monitoring
   - Core Web Vitals tracking
   - Error monitoring

## Performance Budget Targets

### Initial Load Performance
- **First Contentful Paint**: <2.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: <4s
- **Time to Interactive**: <5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: <0.1

### Bundle Size Targets
- **Initial Bundle**: <500KB gzipped
- **Total Bundle**: <2MB gzipped
- **Chunk Size**: <100KB per route

### Runtime Performance
- **API Response Time**: <300ms
- **Page Navigation**: <200ms
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB steady state

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Fix lucide-react imports and enable production builds
2. **Week 1**: Complete bundle analysis and implement code splitting
3. **Week 2**: Database optimization and API response caching
4. **Week 3**: Frontend performance optimization and monitoring setup
