# Kanban Board Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **Supabase Import Path Correction**
   - Fixed the import path in Pipeline.tsx from `@/lib/supabase` to `@/lib/supabase/client`
   - Added a diagnostic log to confirm successful Supabase client loading

2. **Drag and Drop Functionality Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in the `handleDragEnd` function
   - Added fallback mechanism that tries both context-based and direct Supabase updates
   - Ensured proper stage_id updates in both local state and database
   - Added toast notifications for better user feedback

3. **React Context Optimization**
   - Updated PipelineContext to use `useMemo` instead of `useCallback` for computed values
   - Properly memoized context values to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - Fixed Hot Module Replacement (HMR) issues

## Verification Process

To confirm the fixes are working:

1. Start the application with `npm run dev`
2. Follow the verification steps in `docs/verify-kanban-fixes.md`
3. Manual testing is currently the best approach (see `tests/manual-kanban-test.md`)

## Implementation Details

### Pipeline.tsx Changes
- Updated Supabase import path
- Modified handleDragEnd to implement a two-step update process:
  1. First attempt using the context's moveDealToStage function
  2. Fall back to direct Supabase update if the first approach fails
- Added better error handling and recovery mechanisms

### PipelineContext.tsx Changes
- Switched from useCallback to useMemo for computed values
- Added proper dependency arrays to prevent stale data
- Memoized the entire context value object

## Future Recommendations

1. Implement more robust automated testing for drag-and-drop functionality
2. Add loading indicators during stage transitions
3. Consider optimistic UI updates with proper rollback on failure
4. Add more explicit type definitions to improve type safety
