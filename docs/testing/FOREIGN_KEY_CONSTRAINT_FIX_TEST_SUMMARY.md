# Foreign Key Constraint Fix - Comprehensive Test Suite

## Overview

This document provides a complete testing strategy for verifying the foreign key constraint fix that resolves race conditions between deal creation and proposal activity creation.

## The Problem Fixed

**Issue**: Foreign key constraint violation when creating proposal activity immediately after deal creation
**Error**: PostgreSQL error code 23503 
**Root Cause**: Race condition where activity creation attempts to reference a deal_id before the deal transaction is fully committed

## The Solution Tested

1. **Initial Delay**: 500ms delay before creating proposal activity
2. **Error Detection**: Catches foreign key constraint errors (code 23503)
3. **Retry Logic**: Automatic retry with 1000ms delay on foreign key errors
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Deal creation succeeds even if activity creation fails

## Test Architecture

### 1. Unit Tests (`src/tests/ForeignKeyConstraintFix.test.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Test isolated retry logic and error handling
**Tools**: Vitest, React Testing Library
**Coverage**: 
- ✅ 500ms initial delay verification
- ✅ Foreign key error detection (code 23503 & message matching)
- ✅ Retry mechanism with 1000ms delay
- ✅ Maximum 2 attempts to prevent infinite loops
- ✅ Graceful error handling when both attempts fail
- ✅ Correct behavior for non-proposal actions
- ✅ Non-foreign-key errors don't trigger retry
- ✅ Component cleanup prevents memory leaks

**Key Test Cases**:
```typescript
// Verifies initial delay
it('should create proposal activity with initial 500ms delay')

// Verifies retry on foreign key error
it('should retry with 1000ms delay on foreign key constraint error')

// Verifies error code detection
it('should handle foreign key error with code 23503')

// Verifies graceful degradation
it('should show error message if retry fails')

// Verifies behavior for different action types
it('should not create proposal activity when actionType is not "proposal"')
```

### 2. Integration Tests (`src/tests/integration/DealProposalFlow.integration.test.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Test complete database interaction flow
**Tools**: Vitest with mocked Supabase client
**Coverage**:
- ✅ Full deal + proposal creation workflow
- ✅ Database transaction timing simulation
- ✅ Race condition scenario reproduction
- ✅ Error recovery from temporary database issues
- ✅ Concurrent request handling
- ✅ Network interruption simulation
- ✅ Database response validation

**Key Test Scenarios**:
```typescript
// Happy path verification
it('should create deal and proposal activity successfully')

// Race condition handling
it('should handle foreign key constraint error and retry')

// Persistent error handling
it('should handle persistent foreign key errors gracefully')

// Network issue simulation
it('should handle database connection issues')
```

### 3. End-to-End Tests (`tests/e2e/foreign-key-constraint-fix.spec.ts`)

**Purpose**: Test complete user workflow with real database
**Tools**: Playwright
**Coverage**:
- ✅ Complete UI interaction flow
- ✅ Real database operations with foreign key constraints
- ✅ Network interruption handling
- ✅ Performance under rapid successive operations
- ✅ Data consistency verification
- ✅ Browser state management during errors
