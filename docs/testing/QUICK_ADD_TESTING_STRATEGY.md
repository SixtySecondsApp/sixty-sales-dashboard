# Quick Add Modal - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the complete testing strategy for the Quick Add modal functionality in the sixty-sales-dashboard application. The Quick Add modal is a critical component that allows users to create various types of activities, tasks, and deals.

## Testing Architecture

### 1. Unit Tests (`src/tests/`)
- **QuickAdd.comprehensive.test.tsx** - Complete unit test suite
- **QuickAdd.activityTypes.test.tsx** - Specific business logic tests
- **QuickAdd.test.tsx** - Original outbound activity tests

### 2. E2E Tests (`tests/e2e/`)
- **quick-add.spec.ts** - End-to-end workflow testing

## Tested Components and Features

### Core Quick Add Functionality
✅ **Modal State Management**
- Modal opening/closing
- Form reset on close/reopen
- Navigation between action selection and forms
- Back button functionality

✅ **Action Selection Interface**
- All 6 action buttons displayed correctly
- Proper routing to respective forms
- Visual feedback and animations

### Task Creation Workflow
✅ **Task Form Validation**
- Required title validation
- Task type selection (7 types: call, email, meeting, follow_up, demo, proposal, general)
- Priority selection (4 levels: low, medium, high, urgent)
- Due date handling (quick dates + custom datetime)
- Optional description and contact info

✅ **Task Business Logic**
- Creates records in tasks table only
- Does not create activities or deals
- Proper user assignment and metadata
- Contact name and company association

### Meeting Creation (SQL Meetings)
✅ **Meeting Types Supported**
- Discovery meetings
- Demo presentations  
- Follow-up calls
- Proposal meetings
- Client calls
- Other meeting types

✅ **Meeting Status Management**
- **Completed** - Past meetings that occurred
- **Pending** - Scheduled future meetings (SQL)
- **Cancelled** - Meetings that were cancelled
- **No Show** - Meetings where prospect didn't attend

✅ **Meeting Validation**
- Required contact identifier (email/phone/LinkedIn)
- Required meeting type selection
- Required prospect name
- Optional deal linking

### Proposal Creation (Verbal Commitments)
✅ **Proposal Business Logic**
- **Required deal association** - Cannot create proposal without deal
- Deal creation through DealWizard integration
- LTV calculation: `(Monthly MRR × 3) + One-off Revenue`
- Contact identifier requirement
- Creates activity record with calculated amount

✅ **Verbal Commitment Flow**
1. Select "Add Proposal"
2. DealWizard opens (required)
3. Create or select existing deal
4. Fill proposal details with revenue amounts
5. System calculates total LTV
6. Creates proposal activity linked to deal

### Sales Creation
✅ **Sale Types Supported**
- **One-off sales** - Single payment transactions
- **Subscription sales** - Recurring monthly revenue
- **Lifetime sales** - One-time payment for lifetime access

✅ **Sale Business Logic**
- Auto-creates pipeline deal if none selected
- Same LTV calculation as proposals
- Creates both sale activity AND pipeline deal
- Deal placed in "Closed Won" stage automatically
- Links sale activity to created/selected deal

✅ **Revenue Calculation**
- **One-off**: Direct amount entry
- **Subscription**: `Monthly MRR × 3` for LTV
- **Mixed**: `(Monthly MRR × 3) + One-off Revenue`

### Outbound Activities
✅ **Outbound Types**
- Call outreach
- Client calls
- Email campaigns
- LinkedIn outreach
- Other outreach methods

✅ **Outbound Unique Features**
- Contact identifier is **optional** (only activity type that allows this)
- Quantity field for bulk outreach tracking
- Creates activity record only
- No deal creation or requirement

### Deal Creation (DealWizard Integration)
✅ **Direct Deal Creation**
- "Create Deal" button opens DealWizard
- Standalone deal creation flow
- Contact search and creation integration
- Deal stages and pipeline integration

✅ **Deal Integration Workflows**
- Sales → Auto-create deal if none selected
- Proposals → Required deal selection/creation
- Meetings → Optional deal linking
- Outbound → Optional deal linking

## Business Logic Validation

### LTV (Lifetime Value) Calculation
```
LTV = (Monthly MRR × 3) + One-off Revenue
```
**Examples:**
- MRR: £1,000, One-off: £5,000 → LTV: £8,000
- MRR: £500, One-off: £0 → LTV: £1,500  
- MRR: £0, One-off: £10,000 → LTV: £10,000

### Pipeline Integration Rules
| Activity Type | Creates Deal | Requires Deal | Links to Deal |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Task | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Outbound | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (Optional) |
| Meeting | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (Optional) |
| Proposal | ❌ | ✅ (Required) | ✅ (Always) |
| Sale | ✅ (Auto-create) | ❌ | ✅ (Always) |
| Deal | ✅ (Direct) | ❌ | ✅ (Self) |

### Contact Processing Rules
| Activity Type | Identifier Required | Auto-processes Contact |
|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Task | ❌ | ❌ |
| Outbound | ❌ | ✅ (If provided) |
| Meeting | ✅ | ✅ |
| Proposal | ✅ | ✅ |
| Sale | ✅ | ✅ |

## Test Scenarios Covered

### Happy Path Scenarios
1. ✅ Create task with all fields populated
2. ✅ Create discovery meeting with email identifier
3. ✅ Create proposal with deal and revenue calculation
4. ✅ Create subscription sale with auto-deal creation
5. ✅ Create LinkedIn outbound with quantity tracking
6. ✅ Create deal directly through wizard

### Validation Scenarios
1. ✅ Empty task title rejection
2. ✅ Missing meeting type validation
3. ✅ Missing contact identifier for non-outbound activities
4. ✅ Required deal for proposals
5. ✅ Revenue amount validation

### Edge Cases
1. ✅ Outbound without contact identifier (allowed)
2. ✅ Task with custom due date/time
3. ✅ Meeting with no-show status
4. ✅ Sale with only MRR (no one-off)
5. ✅ Proposal with only one-off (no MRR)
6. ✅ Form reset on modal close/reopen

### Integration Scenarios
1. ✅ Activity creation triggers contact processing
2. ✅ Sale creation auto-creates pipeline deal
3. ✅ Proposal links to selected/created deal
4. ✅ Dashboard display of created records
5. ✅ Pipeline integration for deals

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock Users
- `test-user-id` - Standard test user
- User profile with first_name, last_name for sales_rep field

### Mock Deals  
- `mock-deal-id` - Standard deal for linking tests
- Deal with company name for auto-population
- Multiple deal stages for selection

### Mock Contacts
- Various contact types (email, phone, LinkedIn)
- Existing contacts for linking tests
- New contacts for auto-creation tests
