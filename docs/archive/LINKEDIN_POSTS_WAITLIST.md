# 20 LinkedIn Posts for 60 Waitlist

Personal posts from Andrew's perspective as a founder who did founder-led sales for 10 years, built a system that works, and now helps other founders do the same.

## Post 1: The £60K Wake-Up Call

I lost a £60,000 deal because I forgot to send an email. :man-facepalming:

Not a cold prospect. A warm one. Great meeting. They asked me to send a proposal.

I said "by end of day."

Then I got busy. Client work. Team stuff. The hundred other things founders juggle. The proposal sat in my drafts.

Two weeks later, I remembered.

They'd already signed with a competitor.

That was my breaking point.

I realised I wasn't bad at sales. I was drowning in everything that happens after the sales call.

So I built an AI system that never forgets.

60 sends follow-ups automatically. Generates proposals in 60 seconds. Handles the admin I kept screwing up.

If you're a founder who's ever lost a deal to your own inbox, I built this for you.

## Post 2: 10 Years of Founder-Led Sales

For 10 years, I was the sales team.

CEO. Founder. And the only person bringing in new business.

No playbook. No process. No predictability.

Just me, trying to juggle client delivery, team management, and somehow still finding time to sell.

I tracked my time one week. Here's what I found:

→ 6 hours writing proposals
→ 5 hours prepping for meetings
→ 4 hours on forgotten follow-ups
→ 3 hours responding to inquiries
→ 2 hours updating the CRM

20 hours. On admin. Not selling.

That's when I decided to build 60.

Now my team follows a proven system. And I've got my time back.

## Post 3: The Founder's Confession

I need to be honest about something.

I never set out to be a salesperson. :see_no_evil:

I started a business. Sales was just one of the hats I had to wear.

For 10 years.

→ New inquiries sat unanswered for days (I was busy with clients)
→ Follow-ups only happened if I set 4 reminders
→ Proposals took hours because I'd forget what we discussed
→ Meeting prep meant Googling them 2 minutes before the call

I grew the business in spite of myself.

So I asked: What if I could build a system that handled all the bits I was terrible at?

That's 60.

It captures what happens in your meetings and handles all the admin automatically.

You focus on running your business. It handles the sales follow-through.

If you're a founder wearing too many hats, I built this for us: use60.com/waitlist

## Post 4: The 11 PM Proposal

Last year, I finished a proposal at 11:47 PM.

My family was asleep. I'd missed dinner. Again.

The prospect had asked for it "by end of week."

It was Thursday night.

I remember sitting there thinking: I'm not working late because I'm building something great. I'm working late because I can't keep up with admin.

I have a team of 10. I should be leading them. Not writing proposals at midnight.

That was the moment I decided to build 60.

Now proposals take 60 seconds. The AI writes them from your meeting notes.

Founders using 60 aren't working nights anymore. They're running their businesses.

If you're tired of choosing between family and follow-ups, join the waitlist: use60.com/waitlist

You didn't start a business to work at midnight.

## Post 5: Why Most Founders Hate Sales

Here's a truth nobody talks about:

Most founders didn't start their business because they love selling.

They started because they're great at something else. :thinking_face:

But for years, they end up as the only salesperson.

No process. No predictability. No system.

Just grinding through founder-led sales while trying to run everything else.

I did this for 10 years. Built a team of 10 people. And still couldn't escape the sales treadmill.

Until I built 60.

Now I have a system. A process. Predictability.

My team follows it. I don't have to be in every deal anymore.

## Post 6: The Monday Morning Disaster

Every Monday, I had the same problem. :weary:

12 inquiries from the weekend. All sitting in my inbox.

But I had a team standup. Client calls. A hundred fires to put out.

By the time I responded Tuesday afternoon, two had already booked with competitors.

Not because they liked those competitors more.

Because those competitors responded first.

I was losing deals before I even had a chance to sell.

That's why 60 drafts responses to inquiries instantly. Even when you're busy running your business.

Founders using it are capturing leads they used to lose.

## Post 7: What 10 Years Taught Me

After 10 years of founder-led sales, I finally figured out what was broken.

It wasn't my pitch. It wasn't my product. It wasn't my pricing.

It was the follow-through.

Same three problems, every single year:

1. I'd forget to follow up
2. Proposals took forever
3. I never had time to prep for meetings

I wasn't failing at sales. I was failing at admin.

So I built a system that handles all of it automatically.

→ Follow-ups sent in 5 minutes (not 48 hours)
→ Proposals ready in 60 seconds (not 2-3 hours)
→ Meeting prep done automatically (not 30 minutes of scrambling)

Now my team runs this system. And it works.

## Post 8: The Follow-Up That Saved a Deal

True story from last month: :sweat_smile:

Great discovery call on Tuesday. Prospect was ready to move.

Wednesday: client emergency, team issues, inbox exploding.

Thursday: completely forgot about the follow-up.

Friday morning, I woke up in a panic.

But 60 had already sent it. Tuesday night. Automatically.

The prospect replied Thursday: "When can we start?"

I almost lost that deal. The system saved it.

That's the difference between "I should follow up" and "it's already done."

## Post 9: From Chaos to System

For 10 years, my sales "process" was chaos.

Leads came in. I'd respond when I could. Follow-ups happened... sometimes.

No wonder growth was unpredictable.

Now I have a system. And the difference is night and day. :raised_hands:

→ Proposals: 2 hours → 60 seconds
→ Follow-ups: whenever I remembered → automatic
→ Meeting prep: 30 minutes of scrambling → automatic
→ CRM updates: never → automatic

My team follows this process. It's predictable. It's scalable.

I finally have founder-led growth that doesn't depend on me doing everything.

## Post 10: The Competitor Who Beat Me

I lost a deal last year to a competitor with a worse product.

Worse features. Higher price. Less experience.

But they followed up faster. :man-shrugging:

While I was putting out fires at my own company, they'd already sent their proposal.

While I was planning my follow-up, they'd already called twice.

Speed beat quality.

That's when I realised: founders lose deals because we're busy, not because we're bad at sales.

60 sends follow-ups in 5 minutes. Proposals in 60 seconds.

Even when you're juggling everything else.

## Post 11: What Happens After You Join

Founders keep asking what happens when they join the 60 waitlist.

Here's the honest answer:

1. You'll get early access before public launch
2. You'll lock in 50% off for life
3. You'll get priority onboarding (we set up your workflows for you)
4. You'll finally have a sales system that doesn't depend on you

Right now, 600+ founders and sales teams are on the list.

We're onboarding in small batches to make sure everyone gets white-glove support.

If you're tired of being the bottleneck in your own sales process, this is your chance: use60.com/waitlist

## Post 12: I Built This at 6 AM

For six months, I woke up at 5:30 AM to build 60. :alarm_clock:

Before my kids woke up. Before the workday started.

Because I knew what it felt like to stay late finishing proposals.

To miss family dinners because of "just one more follow-up."

To spend Sundays catching up on sales admin instead of resting.

After 10 years of this, I was done.

I didn't build 60 to start another company.

I built it because I was desperate for a system that actually worked.

Now other founders are using it. And they're getting their lives back.

## Post 13: The Meeting Prep I Used to Hate

I used to spend 30 minutes prepping for every 30-minute sales call.

But I'm a founder. I've got 50 other things demanding my attention.

So I'd scramble. Google them 2 minutes before. Hope I remembered what we discussed last time. :stopwatch:

Now 60 sends me a Slack message before every meeting:

→ Who they are and what they care about
→ What we discussed last time
→ What I promised to do
→ What questions to ask

All the prep work, done automatically.

That's hours back every week. Hours I spend actually running my business.

## Post 14: The CRM I Never Updated

Confession: I hate updating the CRM.

Hate it. :unamused:

As a founder, the last thing I want to do after a sales call is log notes, update stages, and fill in custom fields.

So I didn't. The CRM was always out of date. My team had no visibility.

Now 60 updates it automatically.

Call ends → notes logged → stage updated → next steps scheduled.

My team can see exactly where every deal stands. Without me having to do anything.

If your CRM is a ghost town, this will fix it: use60.com/waitlist

## Post 15: From Unpredictable to Predictable

For 10 years, I had no idea where next month's revenue was coming from.

Some months were great. Others were terrifying.

No pipeline visibility. No follow-up system. No predictability. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Now I have a process that works:

→ Every inquiry gets an instant response
→ Every meeting gets an automatic follow-up
→ Every proposal goes out in 60 seconds
→ Every deal is tracked without manual updates

My team runs this system. I finally have predictable growth.

## Post 16: The Feature Nobody Wanted

I spent 6 weeks building a feature nobody used. :man-facepalming:

Beautiful dashboard. Analytics. Insights.

Showed it to founders in our beta.

"Cool. But can it just send me a Slack message?"

They didn't want fancy. They wanted helpful.

Founders don't have time to learn new dashboards. They need things done automatically.

So I deleted 6 weeks of work and built what they actually needed.

Now 60 is simple:

→ Your calls happen
→ Admin work happens automatically
→ You run your business

No dashboards to learn. No workflows to configure.

Just less admin, more growth.

## Post 17: What Founder Time Is Really Worth

As a founder, your time is your most valuable asset.

Every hour you spend on sales admin is an hour not spent on:

→ Your team
→ Your product
→ Your customers
→ Your strategy

I spent 10+ hours a week on sales admin for years.

That's 500+ hours a year. Doing work that doesn't grow the business.

I built 60 because I was tired of wasting my most valuable resource.

Founders using it are getting 10+ hours back weekly. That's 500+ hours a year to spend on what actually matters.

## Post 18: The Sunday Night Inbox

I used to spend every Sunday night in my inbox. :pensive:

Catching up on follow-ups I forgot.
Writing proposals I promised on Friday.
Prepping for Monday's meetings.

Not because I loved working Sundays.

Because I was drowning during the week.

Running a team of 10. Managing clients. Trying to grow the business. Sales admin kept slipping.

Now 60 handles it all automatically. During business hours.

I haven't opened my laptop on a Sunday in 4 months.

## Post 19: The 60-Second Proposal

Last week, I sent a proposal 47 seconds after hanging up with a prospect. :rocket:

They replied immediately: "That was fast."

We closed the deal 3 days later.

Old me would've sent that proposal 3 days later. After client work. After team stuff. After everything else.

By then, they would've talked to competitors. Momentum would've died.

60 generates proposals from your meeting notes. In 60 seconds.

Custom. Professional. Ready to send.

While your prospect is still excited. While you're free to get back to running your business.

## Post 20: Why I'm Sharing This

I've been building 60 for 8 months.

Every post I write is a little scary. :sweat:

What if people judge me for losing that £60K deal?
What if they think I'm just selling something?
What if this whole thing fails?

But I keep sharing because I know I'm not alone.

There are thousands of founders right now:

→ Wearing the sales hat because they have to
→ Losing deals to forgotten follow-ups
→ Spending nights and weekends on admin
→ Growing their business without any predictable system

I was that founder for 10 years.

Now I have a team that follows a proven process. And I'm helping other founders do the same.

If you're ready to 10x your output and build a real sales system, join the waitlist: use60.com/waitlist

600+ founders already waiting. Early access starts soon.

Let's stop doing admin and start scaling.
