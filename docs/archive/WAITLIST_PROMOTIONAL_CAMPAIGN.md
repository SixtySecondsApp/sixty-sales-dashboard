## 2. Founder Story Angles (Andrew's Journey)

### Angle A: "I Built This Because I Was Terrible at Follow-ups"

Andrew, CEO of Sixty, had a problem. He was great on sales calls but terrible at everything after. New inquiries sat unanswered. Follow-ups never happened. Meeting prep took hours. Proposals were rushed or forgotten entirely.

He wasn't lazy—he was drowning in admin while trying to sell.

So he built an AI assistant that does what he couldn't: instant follow-ups, automated meeting prep, proposals that write themselves. Now he's on more calls, closing more deals, and never dropping the ball.

**If you're a great seller stuck doing admin, this is for you.**

---

### Angle B: "The $50K Deal I Lost Because I Forgot to Follow Up"

Andrew remembers the exact moment he knew something had to change.

A hot prospect. Perfect fit. Great meeting. They asked him to send over a proposal "by end of week."

He got busy. New leads came in. Other fires needed fighting. The proposal sat in his drafts folder.

By the time he remembered—two weeks later—they'd signed with a competitor.

**$50,000 gone.** Not because his product wasn't better. Not because his pitch wasn't strong. Because he forgot to follow up.

That's when he decided: if he couldn't be trusted with admin, he'd build an AI that could.

Now every meeting automatically triggers follow-ups, proposals, and prep work. No human memory required.

---

### Angle C: "I Was Spending 20 Hours a Week NOT Selling"

Andrew did something most founders avoid: he tracked his time for two weeks.

The results were brutal:
- 6 hours writing proposals
- 5 hours prepping for meetings
- 4 hours chasing follow-ups he'd forgotten
- 3 hours responding to inquiries
- 2 hours updating CRM records

**20 hours. Half his workweek. Zero revenue generated.**

He was a sales rep who barely had time to sell.

So he asked a simple question: "What if AI did all of this?"

Six months later, he had his answer. An AI assistant that captures meeting context and handles every admin task automatically. Now he spends 35 hours selling, 5 hours managing the AI.

His close rate doubled. Not because he got better at sales. Because he finally had time to do it.

---

## 3. Pain-Point Focused Messaging

### Version A: The Follow-up Failure

**"You're Not Bad at Sales. You're Bad at Admin."**

You know the feeling:
- Great meeting ends
- You promise to follow up
- Life happens
- You forget
- Deal goes cold

It's not a skill problem. It's a bandwidth problem. You're too busy selling to handle what happens after the sale.

**Our AI remembers when you forget.** Automatic follow-ups. Every time. No exceptions.

---

### Version B: The Inbox Avalanche

**"New Inquiry Comes In. You're On a Call. By the Time You Respond, They've Moved On."**

Speed matters in sales. But you can't be in two places at once.

While you're closing one deal, ten inquiries sit unanswered. By the time you get back to them, they've gone with whoever responded first.

**AI responds instantly.** Qualifies leads. Books meetings. Keeps your pipeline full while you're on calls.

---

### Version C: The Proposal Bottleneck

**"Proposals Take Hours. Prospects Want Them in Minutes."**

You finish a great discovery call. They're ready to move forward. They ask for a proposal.

You say "I'll send it over today."

Then reality hits: pulling data, customizing pricing, formatting, proofreading. Three hours later, you finally hit send.

But they needed it two hours ago. Momentum's gone.

**AI generates proposals in 60 seconds.** Custom. Accurate. Professional. While the prospect is still excited.

---

### Version D: The Meeting Prep Time Sink

**"You're Spending More Time Prepping for Meetings Than Actually Selling."**

Before every call, you're scrambling:
- Reviewing notes from last conversation
- Researching their company
- Remembering what you promised
- Pulling relevant case studies

30 minutes of prep for a 30-minute call. You're a researcher, not a seller.

**AI does the prep work.** Meeting briefs generated automatically from your CRM, past conversations, and their website. You show up prepared in 2 minutes, not 30.

---

## 4. Before/After Transformation

### Visual Comparison

| Metric | WITHOUT AI | WITH AI |
|--------|------------|---------|
| Hours on admin/week | 20+ | 2 |
| Follow-up delay | 24-48 hours | 5 minutes |
| Proposal creation | 2-3 hours each | 60 seconds |
| Inquiry response | Next day | Instant |
| Meeting prep | 30 min/meeting | 2 min/meeting |
| Close rate | 18% | 31% |
| Deals in pipeline | 12 | 34 |
| Feeling | Exhausted, behind | In control, crushing it |

---

### Transformation Statement

> "I went from drowning in admin to closing 2x more deals in the same work week."

**Before:** 15 meetings/week, endless admin, constant stress, felt always behind

**After:** 28 meetings/week, AI handles admin, zero dropped balls, work-life balance restored

---

## 5. Social Proof & Urgency Messaging

### Version A: Scarcity + Validation

**"500 Sales Reps. 90-Day Waitlist. Zero Ads."**

We haven't spent a dollar on marketing. Every person on our waitlist heard about us from another sales rep who's already using it.

Why? Because when you give sellers back 10-20 hours per week, they tell everyone.

**Limited spots in our next cohort. Join the waitlist before we're fully booked.**

---

### Version B: Results-Driven Urgency

**"Early Users Are Closing 47% More Deals. Join the Waitlist Before We Hit Capacity."**

We're not accepting everyone. Our AI assistant works best when we onboard users in small batches and optimize workflows based on real feedback.

- Current waitlist: 600+ sales professionals
- Next cohort: 50 spots
- Average wait time: 6-8 weeks

**The longer you wait to join, the longer you'll be doing admin manually.**

---

### Version C: FOMO-Driven

**"Your Competitors Are Already on the Waitlist."**

While you're manually writing proposals at 11 PM, they're queuing up for AI that does it automatically.

While you're forgetting follow-ups, they're getting reminders sent without lifting a finger.

While you're losing deals to slow response times, they're responding instantly—even when they're asleep.

**Don't get left behind. Secure your spot now.**

---

## 6. Short-Form Ad Copy (Social Media)

### LinkedIn/Facebook Ad - Version A (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

**Stop Losing Deals to Admin Work**

You're great at selling. Terrible at follow-ups.

You close meetings strong, then get buried in proposals, meeting prep, and CRM updates. By the time you follow up, prospects have gone cold.

It's not your fault. You literally can't be on calls AND do admin at the same time.

**That's where our AI comes in.**

It captures meeting context and handles everything after the call:
→ Follow-ups sent automatically
→ Proposals generated in 60 seconds
→ Meeting prep done for you
→ Inquiries qualified instantly

**You sell. AI handles the rest.**

Andrew, our CEO, built this because he kept losing deals to forgotten follow-ups. Now he closes 2x more with half the stress.

**Join 600+ sales reps on the waitlist. Limited spots in our next cohort.**

### LinkedIn/Facebook Ad - Version B (Founder Story)

**I Was Spending 20 Hours a Week NOT Selling**

Andrew here, CEO.

I tracked my time for two weeks. The results were brutal:

- 6 hours writing proposals
- 5 hours prepping for meetings
- 4 hours on forgotten follow-ups
- 3 hours responding to inquiries

**20 hours of admin. Zero revenue.**

So I built an AI assistant that does all of it. Now I spend 35 hours selling instead of 15.

My close rate doubled. Not because I got better at sales. Because I finally had time to actually sell.

**If you're drowning in post-call admin, this is for you.**

→ Automatic follow-ups
→ 60-second proposals
→ Instant inquiry responses
→ AI meeting prep

**Join the waitlist. 50 spots in our next cohort.**

### LinkedIn/Facebook Ad - Version C (Vulnerability)

**The $50K Deal I Lost Because I Forgot to Follow Up**

Perfect prospect. Great meeting. They asked for a proposal by Friday.

I got busy. New leads. Other fires. The proposal sat in my drafts.

Two weeks later, I remembered. Too late. They'd signed with a competitor.

**I lost $50,000 because I forgot to send an email.**

That's when I knew something had to change. If I couldn't trust myself with admin, I'd build an AI that could.

Six months later, we launched. Now every meeting automatically triggers:
→ Follow-up emails
→ Proposal generation
→ Meeting prep
→ CRM updates

**I never drop the ball anymore. Because the AI never forgets.**

If you're a great seller stuck doing terrible admin, join 600+ reps already on our waitlist.

**Limited spots. Next cohort onboards in 3 weeks.**

## 7. Landing Page Copy Structure

### Hero Section

**Headline:** Stop Doing Admin. Start Closing Deals.

**Subheadline:** AI-powered assistant that handles follow-ups, proposals, and meeting prep automatically—so you can focus on what you do best: selling.

**CTA:** Join the Waitlist (600+ Already In Line)

### Problem Section

**Headline:** You're Not Bad at Sales. You're Drowning in Admin.

Every sales rep knows this cycle:

Great meeting → Promise to follow up → Get distracted → Forget → Deal goes cold.

It's not a skill issue. It's a bandwidth issue.

**The numbers don't lie:**
- 45% of sales reps say admin work prevents them from selling
- Average rep spends 21% of their day on data entry
- 71% of reps say they spend too much time on non-selling activities

**Meanwhile:**
- Inquiries sit unanswered for 24+ hours
- Follow-ups get forgotten or delayed
- Proposals take 2-3 hours to create
- Meeting prep eats your mornings

You're losing deals not because you're bad at selling. Because you're too busy NOT selling.

---

### Solution Section

**Headline:** Meet Your AI Sales Assistant

Imagine this:

You finish a discovery call. Immediately:
- AI sends a follow-up email summarizing key points
- Generates a custom proposal in 60 seconds
- Books a follow-up meeting based on prospect availability
- Updates your CRM with notes and next steps
- Queues meeting prep for your next call

**All while you're moving to your next prospect.**

**How It Works:**

1. **Capture Meeting Context** - AI listens to your calls or integrates with your meeting notes
2. **Transpose Into Workflows** - Meeting data flows into follow-up sequences, proposals, meeting prep
3. **Execute Automatically** - No manual work. AI handles it while context is fresh.

### Founder Story Section

**Headline:** Why I Built This: A Founder's Confession

Hi, I'm Andrew—CEO and the guy who built this out of desperation.

Let me be honest: I was a terrible sales rep.

Not at selling. I was great on calls. But everything after the call? Disaster.

- Monday morning: 3 new inquiries from the weekend. I'd respond Tuesday afternoon. Two had already booked with competitors.
- Wednesday: Promised a proposal "by end of day." Finished it Friday at 11 PM.
- Thursday: Totally forgot about a follow-up. Remembered 10 days later. Too late.
- Friday: Spent 4 hours prepping for next week's meetings instead of taking calls.

**The breaking point?** A $50K deal I lost because I forgot to send a follow-up email.

That's when I realized: I don't need to get better at admin. I need to eliminate admin entirely.

Now I spend 35 hours a week selling instead of 15. My close rate went from 18% to 31%.

**If you're a great seller trapped in an admin prison, this is your way out.**

— Andrew

## 8. Competitive Positioning

### Category Creation

Instead of "AI sales assistant," position as:

**"Post-Call Productivity Assistant"**

- Creates a new category you can own
- Narrow enough to be credible
- Differentiates from "conversation intelligence" (Gong) and "revenue intelligence" (Clari)

### Positioning Statement

> "Gong tells you what happened on the call.
> We handle what happens after.
>
> - Follow-ups written in your voice
> - Proposals generated from transcript context
> - Meeting prep pulled from past conversations
> - 3 hours of admin → 15 minutes
>
> Because you became a sales rep to sell, not to update spreadsheets."
