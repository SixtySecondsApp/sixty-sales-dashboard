# Slack Integration Setup Guide

## Overview
The Sixty Sales workflow system now supports Slack notifications! You can send automated messages to Slack channels when deals are created, updated, or when any workflow trigger fires.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [https://api.slack.com/apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **"Create New App"**
3. Choose **"From scratch"**
4. Enter app details:
   - **App Name**: Sixty Sales Bot (or your preferred name)
   - **Workspace**: Select your Slack workspace
5. Click **"Create App"**

### Step 2: Enable Incoming Webhooks

1. In your app's settings page, find **"Incoming Webhooks"** in the left sidebar
2. Toggle **"Activate Incoming Webhooks"** to **ON**
3. Click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"**
4. Select the channel where you want to post messages
5. Click **"Allow"**
6. Copy the webhook URL (it looks like: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 3: Add More Channels (Optional)

Each channel needs its own webhook URL. To post to multiple channels:

1. Go back to **"Incoming Webhooks"** in your app settings
2. Click **"Add New Webhook to Workspace"** again
3. Select a different channel
4. Copy the new webhook URL for that channel

> **Note**: Each webhook URL is tied to a specific channel. You cannot dynamically change channels with a single webhook URL.

## Troubleshooting

### Test Webhook Fails
- Verify the webhook URL is correct and complete
- Check that the Slack app is installed in your workspace
- Ensure the webhook is still active (not revoked)

### Messages Not Appearing
- Check the workflow is activated
- Verify the trigger conditions are being met
- Check the Slack channel for the message
- Review workflow execution logs

### Wrong Channel
- Remember: Each webhook URL is tied to a specific channel
- To change channels, you need a different webhook URL
- Create a new webhook for each channel you want to post to

## Security Notes

- Webhook URLs should be kept secure and not shared publicly
- Each webhook URL has full posting access to its designated channel
- Revoke unused webhooks from your Slack app settings
- Consider using private channels for sensitive information
