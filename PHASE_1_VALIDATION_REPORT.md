## 🏛️ SOLID Principles & Service Architecture

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **Components:** Each component has a single, well-defined purpose
- **Hooks:** Specialized hooks handle specific domain concerns
- **Services:** Each service handles one business capability

### ✅ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
- **Service Adapters:** Extensible without modifying existing code
- **Component Interfaces:** New components can extend base interfaces
- **Event System:** New events can be added without changing existing handlers

### ✅ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **Interface Compliance:** All implementations are interchangeable
- **Service Contracts:** All services fulfill their interface contracts
- **Component Behavior:** Refactored components behave identically to originals

### ✅ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **Focused Interfaces:** Components depend only on methods they use
- **Specialized Services:** No forced dependencies on unused capabilities
- **Modular Architecture:** Clear separation of concerns

### ✅ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- **Service Layer:** Components depend on abstractions, not concrete services
- **Event-Driven:** Loose coupling through event-driven communication
- **Dependency Injection:** Services injected through DI container
