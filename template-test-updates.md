# Template Test Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Templates Updated So Far:

1. **Instant Lead Welcome** - ‚úÖ Updated (was Follow-up Reminder)
2. **Post-Meeting Action Items** - ‚úÖ Updated (was Welcome Sequence)  
3. **Deal Won Notification** - ‚úÖ Updated (was Task Assignment)
4. **Stale Opportunity Alert** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially updated (was Lead Nurture)

## üîÑ Templates Still Need Updating:

5. **Smart Proposal Follow-up** (currently has Deal Escalation logic)
   - Should test: activity_created trigger with proposal type
   - Should have: condition node for deal value check
   - Should create: multiple follow-up tasks

6. **Lead Scoring & Routing** (currently has Pipeline Automation logic)
   - Should test: activity_created trigger
   - Should have: multiple conditions for scoring
   - Should update: field values and assign owner

7. **Sales to Success Handoff** (currently has Activity Tracker logic)
   - Should test: stage_changed to Signed
   - Should have: multiple actions (notify, task, activity)
   - Category: customer success

8. **Lost Deal Win-back** (currently has No Activity Alert logic)
   - Should test: time_based trigger (90 days)
   - Should have: condition for lost reason
   - Should create: re-engagement task

9. **Deal Velocity Optimizer** (currently has Win Celebration logic)
   - Should test: scheduled trigger (daily)
   - Should have: multiple stage conditions
   - Complex workflow with 7+ nodes

10. **RevOps Command Center** (currently has Monthly Check-in logic)
    - Should test: stage_changed trigger
    - Should have: router node
    - Most complex template with 10+ nodes

## Key Issues Found:

1. **Test names don't match actual templates** - Fixed function names
2. **Template IDs don't match** - Need to use '1' through '10' not 'template-X'
3. **Template structure differs** - Real templates use trigger_1, action_1 naming
4. **Validation logic outdated** - Tests checking for wrong fields

## Current Status:
- 3/10 templates fully updated and working
- 1/10 partially updated
- 6/10 still need complete rewrite
- All trigger/condition/action node tests are working correctly
