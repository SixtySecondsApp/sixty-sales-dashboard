# Check Logs Immediately

## The function now has detailed debug logging.

**Open the logs RIGHT NOW to see:**

🔗 **[OPEN LOGS →](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb/functions/generate-video-thumbnail/logs)**

## What You'll See:

### 1. Environment Variables
```
🔧 Environment check:
   ONLY_BROWSERLESS="..." (skip=...)
   DISABLE_THIRD_PARTY="..." (skip=...)
   skipThirdParty=...
```

### 2. Microlink Attempt
```
📸 Attempting thumbnail capture with Microlink...
   URL: ...
📡 Microlink: Simple viewport screenshot
   Fetching screenshot...
```

### 3. Success or Failure
```
✅ Screenshot captured: X bytes
📤 Starting S3 upload...
```
OR
```
❌ Microlink failed: XXX
```

## Most Likely Issues:

1. **Environment variables are still set** - If you see `skipThirdParty=true`, the variables weren't fully removed
2. **Microlink returns error** - Rate limit or API issue
3. **S3 upload fails** - Credentials or permissions issue

## Quick Fixes:

### If skipThirdParty=true:
```bash
# Force remove all blocking vars
supabase secrets list | grep -i "only_browserless\|disable_third"
# Then manually delete them in dashboard
```

### If Microlink works but S3 fails:
Check AWS credentials are valid

### If nothing is being called:
The function logic has an issue
