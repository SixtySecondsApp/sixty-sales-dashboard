- **Include key identifiers**: Company name, product/service type
- **Be consistent**: Establish naming conventions for your team

### Deal Values
- **Use realistic estimates**: Base on actual conversations and requirements
- **Update regularly**: Adjust values as deals progress
- **Include currency**: All values are in GBP (£)

### Pipeline Management
- **Start with appropriate stage**: Most new deals begin in "Opportunity" or "Lead"
- **Set realistic close dates**: Based on actual prospect timelines
- **Add meaningful descriptions**: Context helps with follow-up and handoffs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Please select a contact first"
- **Cause**: Trying to create deal without selecting/creating a contact
- **Solution**: Complete the contact selection process first

#### "Please fill in all required fields"
- **Cause**: Missing deal name or company name
- **Solution**: Ensure both fields are completed before proceeding

#### "A contact with this email already exists"
- **Cause**: Attempting to create new contact with existing email
- **Solution**: The existing contact is automatically selected - continue with deal creation

#### Contact search not working
- **Cause**: Network issues or server problems
