# Email & Calendar Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. CalendarEventEditor Import Error ✅
**Problem**: `CalendarEventEditor is not defined` error on Calendar page
**Solution**: Added missing import statement for CalendarEventEditor and CalendarAvailability components

### 2. Missing State Variables ✅
**Problem**: `showEventEditor` and `showAvailability` state variables were being used but not defined
**Solution**: Added the missing useState declarations:
```typescript
const [showEventEditor, setShowEventEditor] = useState(false);
const [showAvailability, setShowAvailability] = useState(false);
```

### 3. Email Page Showing Mock Data ✅
**Problem**: Email page was showing hardcoded mock data even when connected to Gmail
**Solution**: 
- Improved data loading logic to check for loading state and errors
- Return empty array when connected but no emails (instead of falling back to mock data)
- Added proper logging for debugging data flow
- Fixed dependency arrays in useMemo hooks

### 4. Calendar Page Data Handling ✅
**Problem**: Calendar was showing mock events instead of Google Calendar data
**Solution**:
- Added loading and error state checks
- Return empty array when connected but no events (cleaner UX)
- Improved error handling and logging
- Fixed dependency arrays in useMemo hooks

### 5. Duplicate Event Modals ✅
**Problem**: Both CalendarEventModal and CalendarEventEditor were being used, causing confusion
**Solution**:
- Standardized on CalendarEventEditor as the primary event editing component
- Updated all event handlers to use showEventEditor state
- Commented out the duplicate CalendarEventModal rendering

## Key Improvements

### Data Loading Pattern
Both Email and Calendar now follow this pattern:
1. Check if service is enabled
2. Check if data is loading
3. Check for errors
4. Process data if available
5. Return empty array when connected but no data
6. Fall back to mock data only when not connected

### Error Handling
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Proper error logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks for data processing errors

### State Management
- Consolidated modal state management
- Fixed missing state variable declarations
- Proper dependency arrays in hooks

## Testing Checklist

### Email Page
- [ ] Connect Gmail account
- [ ] Verify emails load from Gmail (not mock data)
- [ ] Check console for any errors
- [ ] Test email actions (star, archive, mark as read)
- [ ] Send a test email
- [ ] Verify labels display correctly

### Calendar Page
- [ ] Connect Google Calendar
- [ ] Verify events load from Google Calendar
- [ ] Click to create new event
- [ ] Edit existing event
- [ ] Check date/time display is correct
- [ ] Test calendar navigation (month/week/day views)
- [ ] Verify no console errors

## Debug Commands

Check if Gmail is connected:
```javascript
// In browser console
const isGmailEnabled = true; // Check actual value in React DevTools
console.log('Gmail enabled:', isGmailEnabled);
```

Check if Calendar is connected:
```javascript
// In browser console  
const isCalendarEnabled = true; // Check actual value in React DevTools
console.log('Calendar enabled:', isCalendarEnabled);
```

Monitor Edge Function responses:
```bash
# In terminal
supabase functions serve google-gmail --debug
supabase functions serve google-calendar --debug
```

## Known Remaining Issues

1. **Token Refresh**: Tokens expire after 1 hour - automatic refresh is implemented but needs testing
2. **Time Zones**: Calendar events may show in UTC instead of user's timezone
3. **Large Email Lists**: Currently limited to 10 emails for performance
4. **Recurring Events**: Basic support only, complex patterns may not work

## Next Steps

1. Test the fixes thoroughly with real Google accounts
2. Monitor console for any remaining errors
3. Verify data loads correctly from Google services
4. Test edge cases (no emails, no events, expired tokens)
5. Consider implementing pagination for large email/event lists
