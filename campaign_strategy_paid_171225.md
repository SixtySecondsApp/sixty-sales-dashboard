## The 20 Ad Concepts

### Category 1: Fear of Loss (5 Ads)
*Psychological basis: Loss aversion - people fear losing what they have more than gaining something new*

---

#### Ad 1: The £60K Mistake

**Hook/Headline:**
> "I forgot to send a proposal. Cost me £60,000."

**Body Copy:**
Sarah had the verbal yes. Just needed to send the contract. Got distracted, forgot for 4 days. Prospect went with a competitor who followed up same-day. That was 2 years ago. She still thinks about it.

**CTA:** Never lose another deal to a forgotten follow-up →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Single image - screenshot of a proposal reminder notification with "4 days overdue" highlighted in red

**Why It Works:** First-person narrative + specific financial loss + relatable scenario = emotional impact

---

#### Ad 2: The Pipeline Ghost

**Hook/Headline:**
> "73% of your 'hot leads' will ghost you. Not because they don't want it..."

**Body Copy:**
They ghost because YOU forgot to follow up at the exact right moment. The rep who remembers on day 3 closes the deal. You remember on day 9 and get "we went another direction."

**CTA:** See how top performers never forget →

**Platform:** Facebook

**Ad Format:** Video (15 sec) - Animation showing deals literally disappearing from a pipeline, then reappearing with automated reminders

**Why It Works:** Challenges assumption (it's not them, it's you) + specific timing insight

---

#### Ad 3: The Competitor Beat You

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Your competitor didn't win because they were better. They won because they followed up faster."

**Body Copy:**
Same pitch. Same price. They sent the proposal 4 hours after the call. You sent it 2 days later. Guess who signed the contract?

**CTA:** Join 400+ sales pros who automate follow-ups →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Single image - Split screen comparison: "Them: Proposal sent 4hrs later" vs "You: Proposal sent 2 days later"

**Why It Works:** Direct competitive threat + timing specificity + implied solution

---

#### Ad 4: The Silent Revenue Leak

**Hook/Headline:**
> "You're losing 2-3 deals per month. You just don't know which ones."

**Body Copy:**
They don't tell you they went elsewhere. They just stop responding. Why? Because someone else followed up on day 2, and you finally remembered on day 7. The silent commission killer.

**CTA:** Stop the revenue leak - Watch 2-min demo →

**Platform:** Google Display Network

**Ad Format:** Animated banner - Graph showing revenue climbing, then sudden drops with "Forgotten follow-up" labels

**Why It Works:** Unknown loss is psychologically unsettling + "silent killer" metaphor

---

#### Ad 5: The Verbal Agreement Graveyard

**Hook/Headline:**
> "How many 'verbal yeses' are sitting in your pipeline right now, going nowhere?"

**Body Copy:**
They said yes on the call. You meant to send the contract. Got busy. Now it's been 11 days and it feels awkward to reach out. Another one dies in the graveyard of good intentions.

**CTA:** Turn verbal yeses into signed contracts →

**Platform:** Instagram

**Ad Format:** Carousel (3 slides)
- Slide 1: "They said YES on the call"
- Slide 2: "You forgot to send the contract"
- Slide 3: "11 days later... deal is dead"

**Why It Works:** Question format prompts self-reflection + vivid "graveyard" imagery

---

### Category 2: Pain Point / Admin Burden (5 Ads)
*Psychological basis: Time is the most valuable resource for quota-carrying sales professionals*

---

#### Ad 6: The CRM That Works Against You

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Your CRM makes you LESS productive. Here's why."

**Body Copy:**
You spend 9 hours/week updating fields, logging calls, setting manual reminders. The top 10% spend 14 minutes. They automate everything. You're manually doing what software should handle.

**CTA:** See the CRM that works FOR you →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Video script (30 sec)
- 0-5s: Screen recording of endless CRM data entry
- 5-15s: "9 hours per week on admin"
- 15-25s: Quick demo of Sixty automating tasks
- 25-30s: "14 minutes. That's it."

**Why It Works:** Contrarian opening + stark time comparison (9 hours vs 14 minutes)

---

#### Ad 7: The Sunday Night Panic

**Hook/Headline:**
> "It's Sunday night. You're scrolling through your pipeline trying to remember who to follow up with."

**Body Copy:**
This is your life now. Weekend anxiety about Monday's to-dos. Manually creating tasks for every deal. There's a reason top performers never experience this.

**CTA:** End the Sunday scaries - See how →

**Platform:** Facebook

**Ad Format:** Single image - Phone screenshot showing a Sunday evening with notification: "47 follow-ups overdue"

**Why It Works:** Scenario-based hook creates immediate recognition + emotional resonance

---

#### Ad 8: The 47% Time Thief

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Sales reps spend 47% of their week on admin work. You can cut it to 8%."

**Body Copy:**
Every field update, every manual reminder, every status change - it's stealing your selling time. The difference between quota and president's club isn't talent. It's automation.

**CTA:** Reclaim 16 hours/week - Watch demo →

**Platform:** Google Search

**Ad Format:** Text ad with site extensions showing specific time savings

**Why It Works:** Specific statistic + dramatic reduction promise + aspiration hook

---

#### Ad 9: The Tool Stack Nightmare

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Salesforce + Calendly + Asana + Slack + a prayer you don't forget anything."

**Body Copy:**
Five tools to do one job. Every deal lives across 3 platforms. Every follow-up requires 4 manual steps. Your top performer quit last month because of this exact chaos.

**CTA:** See the all-in-one alternative →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Carousel (4 slides) showing logos of different tools, then final slide showing Sixty replacing all of them

**Why It Works:** Humor ("+ a prayer") + relatable frustration + consolidation value prop

---

#### Ad 10: The Proposal Tracking Hellscape

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Did I send that proposal? Did they open it? Should I follow up again?"

**Body Copy:**
You're frantically searching your sent emails, guessing at next steps, hoping you're not annoying them. Meanwhile your quota-crushing colleague has automated proposal tracking and knows exactly when to follow up.

**CTA:** Never wonder about proposal status again →

**Platform:** Instagram

**Ad Format:** Single image - Split screen: "Your inbox chaos" (messy emails) vs "Their dashboard" (clean proposal tracking)

**Why It Works:** Internal monologue resonance + comparison to successful peer

---

### Category 3: Curiosity / Intrigue (5 Ads)
*Psychological basis: Information gaps create tension that can only be resolved by clicking*

---

#### Ad 11: The Secret Weapon

**Hook/Headline:**
> "The top 5% of sales reps know something you don't. And they're not sharing."

**Body Copy:**
It's not their pitch. It's not their charisma. It's a single system that ensures they NEVER forget a follow-up, NEVER miss a proposal deadline, NEVER let a hot lead go cold.

**CTA:** Steal their system - Free waitlist access →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Video (20 sec)
- Dark, mysterious opening
- "What do they know that you don't?"
- Quick flash of automation in action
- "400 sales reps. One unfair advantage."

**Why It Works:** Exclusivity implication + revelation promise + FOMO trigger

---

#### Ad 12: The 3-Day Rule

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Why do top performers always follow up exactly 3 days after sending a proposal?"

**Body Copy:**
It's not a coincidence. It's not their memory. There's a conversion optimization pattern they discovered - and they automated it. While you're guessing, they're closing.

**CTA:** Learn the 3-day rule →

**Platform:** Facebook

**Ad Format:** Single image - Calendar showing "Day 3" circled with "78% close rate" notation

**Why It Works:** Specific pattern reveal + insider knowledge implication

---

#### Ad 13: The Hidden Pattern

**Hook/Headline:**
> "I analyzed 2,847 closed deals. Found something shocking."

**Body Copy:**
The #1 predictor of closing wasn't price, product, or pitch quality. It was follow-up speed after proposal. Under 24 hours: 64% close rate. Over 3 days: 19% close rate. Most reps don't even track this.

**CTA:** See the full analysis + solution →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Carousel (3 slides)
- Slide 1: "2,847 deals analyzed"
- Slide 2: Graph showing close rates vs follow-up timing
- Slide 3: "Top performers automate this. Here's how."

**Why It Works:** Data-driven credibility + surprising insight + actionable promise

---

#### Ad 14: The Unfair Advantage

**Hook/Headline:**
> "There's a reason the same 3 people always win President's Club."

**Body Copy:**
They're not smarter. They're not working harder. They automated the busy work you're still doing manually. While you're updating Salesforce, they're on their 4th call of the day.

**CTA:** Level the playing field - Join waitlist →

**Platform:** Instagram

**Ad Format:** Video (15 sec) - Trophy engraved with same 3 names, then revealing "Their secret: Zero admin time"

**Why It Works:** Competitive jealousy + debunking talent myth + equalizer promise

---

#### Ad 15: The Conversion Multiplier

**Hook/Headline:**
> "What if I told you the average sales rep is sitting on £140K in 'almost closed' deals?"

**Body Copy:**
Dead verbal agreements. Ghosted proposals. Follow-ups you forgot. It's not a pipeline problem. It's a follow-through problem. The fix takes 14 minutes to set up.

**CTA:** Resurrect dead deals - Watch how →

**Platform:** Google Display Network

**Ad Format:** Animated banner - Pipeline with "£140K stuck" label, then showing deals moving to "Closed Won"

**Why It Works:** High-value revelation + simple fix promise + actionable frame

---

### Category 4: Social Proof / Results (5 Ads)
*Psychological basis: Social proof reduces perceived risk and provides vicarious confidence*

---

#### Ad 16: The Comeback Story

**Hook/Headline:**
> "James went from 67% to 94% quota attainment in 8 weeks. Changed literally one thing."

**Body Copy:**
Same leads. Same territory. Same product. He stopped doing admin and started following up obsessively. How? Automated everything that wasn't selling. Now he's #2 in the region.

**CTA:** See James's before/after dashboard →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Single image - Before/after quota attainment graph with quote: "I got 11 hours back per week"

**Why It Works:** Dramatic transformation + specific metrics + relatable peer

---

#### Ad 17: The Revenue Recovery

**Hook/Headline:**
> "£180,000 in 'lost' deals. She closed them in 6 weeks."

**Body Copy:**
Sophie inherited a messy pipeline. 34 deals marked as "no response." She set up automated follow-up sequences. 11 of them responded. 7 closed. £180K in supposedly dead revenue.

**CTA:** See Sophie's resurrection playbook →

**Platform:** Facebook

**Ad Format:** Video testimonial (30 sec)
- Sophie on camera
- "I thought these deals were dead"
- Screen recording of follow-up automations
- "£180K later, I learned my lesson"

**Why It Works:** "Dead deal resurrection" narrative + specific numbers + achievable outcome

---

#### Ad 18: The Time Reclamation

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Sarah saves 14.5 hours per week. Spends it on deals, not data entry."

**Body Copy:**
Used to spend Monday mornings creating tasks for the week. Used to spend Friday afternoons updating pipeline stages. Now? Fully automated. She added 8 meetings per week with that time.

**CTA:** Calculate your time savings →

**Platform:** Instagram

**Ad Format:** Carousel (4 slides)
- Slide 1: "14.5 hours saved/week"
- Slide 2: "= 8 more sales meetings"
- Slide 3: "= 3 more closed deals/month"
- Slide 4: "All from eliminating admin"

**Why It Works:** Cascading benefit chain + concrete time value + calculator CTA

---

#### Ad 19: The Forgotten Follow-Up Fix

**Hook/Headline:**
> "Marcus used to forget 2-3 follow-ups per week. Last month? Zero."

**Body Copy:**
Cost him at least one deal per month. Probably more he doesn't know about. Automated his entire follow-up system. Every proposal tracked. Every verbal agreement monitored. Zero mental overhead.

**CTA:** Join 400+ reps who never forget →

**Platform:** LinkedIn

**Ad Format:** Single image - Marcus's dashboard showing "0 overdue tasks" with his quote: "First time in my career"

**Why It Works:** Before/after transformation + "zero mental overhead" desire + milestone moment

---

#### Ad 20: The President's Club Qualifier

**Hook/Headline:**
> "3 months ago, Emma was at 71% quota. Last week, she qualified for President's Club."

**Body Copy:**
What changed? She eliminated every manual step between "interested prospect" and "signed contract." Automated reminders, proposal tracking, follow-up sequences. Went from reactive to systematic.

**CTA:** See Emma's full transformation →

**Platform:** Facebook

**Ad Format:** Video (45 sec)
- Emma testimonial format
- Walking through her old vs new workflow
- Dashboard showing quota climb: 71% → 94% → 118%

## Retargeting Strategy

| Warm | Clicked ad, didn't convert | "Still losing deals to forgotten follow-ups?" |
| Hot | Viewed landing page 60s+ | "127 spots left on the waitlist" |
| VSL Viewers | Watched 50%+ | "Ready to never forget a proposal again?" |
| Abandonments | Started signup, didn't complete | "Your spot is still available - 24hr hold" |

### Retargeting Sequence
1. **Day 1-3:** Social proof ad (different testimonial)
2. **Day 4-7:** Curiosity ad (pattern reveal)
3. **Day 8-14:** Urgency ad (limited spots)
4. **Day 15+:** Final push (scarcity + discount)

### vs. Close.io

---

## Risk Mitigation

| High CPC | Test broader audiences, adjust bids |
