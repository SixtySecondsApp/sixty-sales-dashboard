## üöÄ Usage Examples

### In React Components

```tsx
import { useNextActions } from '@/lib/hooks/useNextActions'
import { NextActionBadge, NextActionPanel } from '@/components/next-actions'

function MyComponent() {
  const [showPanel, setShowPanel] = useState(false)

  const {
    suggestions,
    pendingCount,
    highUrgencyCount,
    acceptSuggestion,
    dismissSuggestion
  } = useNextActions({
    activityId: meeting.id,
    activityType: 'meeting',
    status: 'pending'
  })

  return (
    <>
      {/* Show badge */}
      {pendingCount > 0 && (
        <NextActionBadge
          count={pendingCount}
          urgency={highUrgencyCount > 0 ? 'high' : 'medium'}
          onClick={() => setShowPanel(true)}
        />
      )}

      {/* Panel for all suggestions */}
      <NextActionPanel
        activityId={meeting.id}
        activityType="meeting"
        isOpen={showPanel}
        onClose={() => setShowPanel(false)}
      />
    </>
  )
}
```

### Manual Generation

```typescript
import { nextActionsService } from '@/lib/services/nextActionsService'

// Generate suggestions manually
const result = await nextActionsService.generateSuggestions(
  meetingId,
  'meeting',
  true // force regenerate
)

console.log(`Generated ${result.count} suggestions`)
```

### Database Functions

```sql
-- Get pending count for user
SELECT get_pending_suggestions_count();

-- Accept suggestion and create task
SELECT accept_next_action_suggestion(
  'suggestion-uuid'::UUID,
  '{"priority": "high"}'::JSONB
);

-- Dismiss suggestion
SELECT dismiss_next_action_suggestion(
  'suggestion-uuid'::UUID,
  'Not relevant to current priorities'
);

-- Regenerate for specific meeting
SELECT regenerate_next_actions_for_activity(
  'meeting-uuid'::UUID,
  'meeting'
);

-- Backfill recent meetings
SELECT backfill_next_actions_for_meetings(10);
```

---

## üîÑ Automatic Generation Flow

1. **Meeting/Activity Created** ‚Üí Database trigger fires
2. **Trigger calls Edge Function** ‚Üí Async via pg_net
3. **Edge Function analyzes context**:
   - Fetches meeting transcript
   - Gets company/deal/contact data
   - Retrieves recent activity history (last 30 days)
4. **Claude Haiku 4.5 generates suggestions**:
   - Analyzes full transcript
   - Identifies buying signals, concerns, objections
   - Recommends 2-4 specific actions with reasoning
5. **Suggestions stored in database**
6. **Real-time updates** ‚Üí React components receive new suggestions
7. **Badge appears** ‚Üí User sees count on meeting card

-- Check meeting counts
SELECT id, title, next_actions_count FROM meetings WHERE next_actions_count > 0;

-- Test manual generation
SELECT regenerate_next_actions_for_activity(
  (SELECT id FROM meetings LIMIT 1),
  'meeting'
);
```

### API Testing

```bash
# Test Edge Function directly
curl -X POST https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/suggest-next-actions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "activityId": "meeting-uuid",
    "activityType": "meeting"
  }'
```

## üí∞ Cost Management

### Claude Haiku 4.5 Pricing
- **Input**: ~$1 per million tokens
- **Output**: ~$5 per million tokens

### Estimated Costs
- Average transcript: ~2,000 tokens input
- Average analysis: ~500 tokens output
- **Cost per analysis**: ~$0.005 (half a cent)
- **1,000 meetings/month**: ~$5/month

### Cost Controls
1. **Rate Limiting**: Max 100 suggestions/user/day
2. **Caching**: 24-hour cache on suggestions
3. **Cooldown**: 1-hour minimum between regenerations
4. **Context Quality**: Skip low-quality transcripts

---

## üîí Security & Permissions

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All policies enforce user ownership:

```sql
-- Users can only see their own suggestions
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own suggestions"
  ON next_action_suggestions FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Users can update their own suggestions
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own suggestions"
  ON next_action_suggestions FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- Service role can insert (from Edge Function)
CREATE POLICY "Service role can insert suggestions"
  ON next_action_suggestions FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (true);
```

### Data Privacy

- All analysis respects RLS policies
- No data leaves Supabase except to Anthropic API
- Transcripts sent to Claude are not stored by Anthropic
- User feedback is stored for quality improvement

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Suggestions Appearing

1. **Check Edge Function logs**:
   ```bash
   supabase functions logs suggest-next-actions
   ```

2. **Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY** is set

3. **Check database triggers**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname LIKE '%next_actions%';
   ```

4. **Verify meeting has transcript**:
   ```sql
   SELECT id, title, transcript_text FROM meetings WHERE transcript_text IS NOT NULL;
   ```

### Suggestions Not Real-Time

1. **Check WebSocket connection** in browser console
2. **Verify Supabase Realtime** is enabled for table
3. **Check React Query** cache settings

### Database Errors

1. **Check pg_net extension**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_net';
   ```

2. **Verify configuration**:
   ```sql
   SHOW app.settings.supabase_url;
   SHOW app.settings.service_role_key;
   ```
