# Next-Actions AI Engine - Complete Implementation Guide

## ðŸŽ‰ Status: PRODUCTION READY

**4 AI suggestions successfully generated** from Jean-Marc meeting transcript!

---

## Quick Start

### 1. **Enable Automatic Generation** (One-time setup)

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- File: UPDATE_TRIGGERS_FOR_AUTO_GENERATION.sql
-- This updates trigger functions to use system_config
```

This will automatically test the trigger with one of your meetings.

### 2. **Generate Suggestions for Existing Meetings**

```sql
-- Generate for all meetings with transcripts
SELECT
  m.id,
  m.title,
  regenerate_next_actions_for_activity(m.id, 'meeting') as result
FROM meetings m
WHERE m.transcript_text IS NOT NULL
  AND (m.next_actions_generated_at IS NULL OR m.next_actions_count = 0)
ORDER BY m.meeting_start DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Wait 10-15 seconds per meeting for AI processing.

### 3. **View Generated Suggestions**

```sql
SELECT
  m.title as meeting_title,
  s.title as suggestion_title,
  s.reasoning,
  s.action_type,
  s.urgency,
  s.confidence_score,
  s.status,
  s.created_at
FROM next_action_suggestions s
JOIN meetings m ON m.id = s.activity_id
WHERE s.status = 'pending'
ORDER BY
  s.urgency DESC,
  s.confidence_score DESC,
  s.created_at DESC;
```

## How It Works

### Automatic Flow (When Fathom Syncs)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Fathom Webhook] --> B[fathom-sync Function]
    B --> C[Fetch Transcript]
    C --> D[Update meetings.transcript_text]
    D --> E[Database Trigger Fires]
    E --> F[call_suggest_next_actions_async]
    F --> G[pg_net queues HTTP request]
    G --> H[suggest-next-actions Edge Function]
    H --> I[Claude Haiku 4.5 AI]
    I --> J[Parse & Store Suggestions]
    J --> K[Update meeting counts]
```

### Components

1. **Database Trigger** (`trigger_auto_suggest_next_actions_meeting`)
   - Fires when `transcript_text` updated
   - Cooldown: 1 hour (prevents duplicates)
   - Conditions: Must have transcript or summary

2. **Helper Function** (`call_suggest_next_actions_async`)
   - Uses `system_config` for URL and auth
   - Calls pg_net.http_post (async)
   - Returns request_id immediately

3. **Edge Function** (`suggest-next-actions`)
   - Fetches meeting + relationships (company, contact, deal)
   - Calls Claude AI with full context
   - Strips markdown from JSON response
   - Inserts 3-5 suggestions per meeting

4. **AI Model** (Claude Haiku 4.5)
   - Analyzes transcript (5-10 seconds)
   - Generates contextual suggestions
   - Scores confidence and urgency
   - Creates custom action types

## Example Output

From Jean-Marc meeting transcript (5,846 characters):

### Suggestion 1: High Urgency (92% confidence)
**Title**: Schedule strategy review meeting for late November

**Reasoning**: Jean-Marc explicitly stated he will have a marketing strategy plan ready in 2-3 weeks (by late November) that he wants to review with marketing-savvy friends first. He invited Andrew to potentially review it as well. This is a critical touchpoint to maintain engagement, provide value-add feedback, and position the agency as a strategic partner.

**Action**: `schedule_strategy_review`

### Suggestion 2: High Urgency (88% confidence)
**Title**: Formalize the 2-month time banking arrangement in writing

**Reasoning**: Jean-Marc and Andrew agreed to bank 2 months of service time (November-December) to be used for a professional explainer video and landing page in January when Jean-Marc has his strategy ready. This needs to be documented in writing to prevent future misunderstandings about deliverables and timeline.

**Action**: `document_banking_agreement`

### Suggestion 3: Medium Urgency (85% confidence)
**Title**: Develop explainer video production brief based on product discussion

**Reasoning**: Both parties agreed that an explainer video is essential for Jean-Marc's SaaS launch. Andrew mentioned they can create a professional 60-second video for ~â‚¬3,000 market value using animations and AI voiceover. Having a detailed brief ready will enable rapid production once Jean-Marc's strategy is finalized.

**Action**: `prepare_video_production_brief`

### Suggestion 4: Medium Urgency (80% confidence)
**Title**: Share marketing strategy framework template to support his planning

**Reasoning**: Jean-Marc is actively working on his marketing strategy but mentioned he's doing self-study with books and evening homework. Sending a practical marketing strategy template would provide immediate value and position Andrew as a strategic advisor.

**Action**: `send_marketing_framework_template`

## User Actions

Users can interact with suggestions in the UI:

### Accept Suggestion â†’ Create Task

```sql
-- Automatically creates a task from suggestion
SELECT accept_next_action_suggestion(
  'SUGGESTION-ID',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'title', 'Custom task title (optional)',
    'due_date', '2025-11-15'::timestamptz,
    'priority', 'high'
  )
);
```

### Dismiss Suggestion

```sql
SELECT dismiss_next_action_suggestion(
  'SUGGESTION-ID',
  'Not relevant at this time'  -- Optional feedback
);
```

### View Pending Count

```sql
SELECT get_pending_suggestions_count(); -- For current user
```

---

## Configuration

### System Config (Already Set)

```sql
SELECT * FROM system_config;
```

Should show:
- `supabase_url`: https://ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb.supabase.co
- `service_role_key`: eyJhbGci... (your key)

### Trigger Settings

Cooldown period (prevent duplicates):
```sql
-- Current: 1 hour
-- To change, edit trigger function line 71:
-- NEW.next_actions_generated_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour'
```

---

## Monitoring

### Dashboard Logs

Edge Function execution logs:
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb/functions/suggest-next-actions/logs

### SQL Monitoring Queries

**Daily summary**:
```sql
SELECT
  DATE(created_at) as date,
  COUNT(*) as suggestions_created,
  COUNT(DISTINCT activity_id) as meetings_analyzed,
  AVG(confidence_score::numeric) as avg_confidence,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'accepted') as accepted_count,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'dismissed') as dismissed_count
FROM next_action_suggestions
GROUP BY DATE(created_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

**Acceptance rate by urgency**:
```sql
SELECT
  urgency,
  COUNT(*) as total,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'accepted') as accepted,
  ROUND(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'accepted')::numeric / COUNT(*) * 100, 1) as acceptance_rate
FROM next_action_suggestions
WHERE status IN ('accepted', 'dismissed')
GROUP BY urgency
ORDER BY urgency DESC;
```

**Top action types**:
```sql
SELECT
  action_type,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  AVG(confidence_score::numeric) as avg_confidence
FROM next_action_suggestions
GROUP BY action_type
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Troubleshooting

### No suggestions created

**1. Check trigger execution**:
```sql
SET client_min_messages TO NOTICE;

UPDATE meetings
SET transcript_text = transcript_text
WHERE id = 'YOUR-MEETING-ID';

-- Should see: "NOTICE: Queued next-action suggestion..."
```

**2. Check Edge Function logs** (Dashboard link above)

**3. Test manual generation**:
```sql
SELECT regenerate_next_actions_for_activity(
  'YOUR-MEETING-ID'::uuid,
  'meeting'
);
```

### Trigger not firing

**Check if trigger exists**:
```sql
SELECT
  trigger_name,
  event_manipulation,
  action_statement
FROM information_schema.triggers
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%suggest_next_actions%';
```

**Re-create trigger** (if missing):
```sql
-- Run: supabase/migrations/20251031120001_create_next_actions_triggers.sql
```

### System config missing

```sql
-- Verify config
SELECT key, LEFT(value, 50) FROM system_config;

-- If missing, set it:
INSERT INTO system_config (key, value, description)
VALUES
  ('supabase_url', 'https://ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb.supabase.co', 'Supabase URL'),
  ('service_role_key', 'YOUR-KEY-HERE', 'Service role key')
ON CONFLICT (key) DO UPDATE SET value = EXCLUDED.value;
```
