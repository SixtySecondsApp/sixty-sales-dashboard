### Hybrid Search Logic

```
Step 1 (fast): Query Sixty DB (active contacts index)
Step 2 (fallback): If no confident match → call CRM API
Step 3: Merge + de-dupe + show best matches with confidence + source badges
```

**When to call CRM**:
- No Sixty match above confidence threshold
- Query looks like email/domain
- User explicitly asks ("in CRM", "search hubspot")
- User clicks "Search CRM" button
