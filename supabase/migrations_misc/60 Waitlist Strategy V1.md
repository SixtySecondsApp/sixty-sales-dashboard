# **60 – Waitlist Launch Messaging V1**

---

## **1\. Target Audience Summary**

### **Primary ICP: Founder-Led B2B Sales Teams**

These individuals directly feel the emotional and financial pain your product solves.

**Who they are:**  
 • Founders, Co-founders, Owners, CEOs  
 • Managing Directors, Sales Directors, Heads of Sales  
 • Small B2B companies (3–50 employees)  
 • Sectors: Agencies, Consultancies, Recruiting firms, SaaS, IT, Creative/Service businesses  
 • UK \+ US

**Why they convert:**  
 • They personally feel responsible for lost deals  
 • They are overwhelmed with after-call admin  
 • They already record meetings but fail to act on them  
 • They value leverage and automation  
 • They prefer tools that slot into their existing stack  
 • They react strongly to loss-based messaging (lost revenue, lost momentum, lost opportunities)

**Core emotional trigger:**

**They’ve already lost deals because they forgot to follow up, send a proposal, or update the CRM — even though the call was recorded.**

This is the behaviour gap your ads must exploit.

# **2\. Ad Concept \#1**

The £60K Deal (Flagship Ad)\*\*

### **Static Text:**

“I lost a £60,000 deal because I forgot to send a proposal.”  
 – Andrew, Founder at Sixty Seconds

### **Caption:**

Our founder Andrew once lost a £60,000 deal because he forgot to send a proposal.

It was the moment that led us to build 60, the AI Sales Agent that handles everything after the call.

If you’ve ever dropped the ball on a follow up, proposal, or CRM update… you’ll want early access to this.

# **3\. Ad Concept \#2**

The Call You Lost Anyway\*\*

### **Static Text:**

“You recorded the call. You still lost the deal.”  
 – Sixty Seconds

### **Caption:**

Recording a meeting doesn’t stop you losing the deal that comes after it.

The follow up still gets forgotten.  
The proposal still sits in drafts.  
The next steps still slip through.

It’s why we built 60, the AI Sales Agent that turns every recorded call into action automatically.

If you’ve ever had the recording… and still lost the opportunity… you’ll want early access to this.

# **4\. Ad Concept \#3**

The Deal You Should Have Won\*\*

### **Static Text:**

“You didn’t lose the deal on the call. You lost it after.”  
 – Sixty Seconds

### **Caption:**

Great calls aren’t the problem. What happens after them is where most revenue is lost.

That’s where tasks get missed, follow ups slip, and recordings gather dust.

It’s why we built 60, the AI Sales Agent that turns every call into instant action.

If you’ve ever watched a warm deal quietly fade away… you’ll want early access to this.

# **Summary:**

These ads all hit the same universal emotional truth:

**Deals aren’t lost on the call — they’re lost because nothing happens after it.**

They combine:

• loss aversion  
 • relatability  
 • truthfulness  
 • emotional shame  
 • clarity of value  
 • irresistible simplicity
