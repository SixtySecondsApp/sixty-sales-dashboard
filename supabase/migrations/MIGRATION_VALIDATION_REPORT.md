   - **Issue**: No explicit BEGIN/COMMIT transaction blocks
   - **Risk**: Partial failures could leave database in inconsistent state
   - **Resolution**: Wrap each migration in explicit transactions

2. **Rollback Procedures**
   - **Issue**: No documented rollback strategy
   - **Risk**: Cannot easily undo changes if issues discovered
   - **Resolution**: Create rollback scripts for each migration

3. **Extension Dependencies**
   - **Issue**: uuid-ossp extension usage not documented
   - **Risk**: Migration failure if extension not installed
   - **Resolution**: Add extension check and installation

#### Performance Considerations
1. **Execution Time Estimation**
   - **Issue**: No estimation of migration duration
   - **Risk**: Unexpected downtime during deployment
   - **Resolution**: Test on production-sized datasets

2. **Lock Duration**
   - **Issue**: Table-level locks during column additions unknown
   - **Risk**: Application unavailability during migration
   - **Resolution**: Consider batched approach for large tables

### 🔴 Not Recommended Without Changes
- Current state lacks production-grade safety measures
- Risk of partial failures and data corruption
- Limited recovery options if problems occur

## Recommended Pre-Production Actions

### 1. Add Transaction Management
```sql
-- Wrap each migration file with:
BEGIN;
-- [existing migration content]
COMMIT;
```

### 2. Create Rollback Scripts
Create corresponding rollback files:
- `20250831000000_rollback_enhanced_crm_schema.sql`
- `20250831000001_rollback_legacy_contact_migration.sql`  
- `20250831000002_rollback_direct_relationships.sql`
- `20250831000003_rollback_rls_policies.sql`

### 3. Add Extension Management
```sql
-- Add to beginning of first migration:
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
```

### 4. Performance Testing
- Test migrations on production-sized dataset
- Measure lock duration for table alterations
- Validate complex view performance under load
- Test analytical function performance

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
Add error handling to complex functions:
```sql
-- Example enhancement for meeting follow-up function
BEGIN
  -- function logic
EXCEPTION 
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    RAISE LOG 'Meeting follow-up creation failed: %', SQLERRM;
    RETURN;
END;
```
