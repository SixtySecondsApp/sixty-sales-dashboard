  # Migration Script: Fix Legacy Contact Relationships - PRODUCTION READY
  
  ## PRODUCTION SAFETY MEASURES:
  ✅ Full transaction management with rollback capability
  ✅ Comprehensive data validation and dependency checks
  ✅ Error handling with detailed logging
  ✅ Performance optimization with batch processing
  ✅ Data integrity validation at each step
  ✅ Rollback script available for emergency recovery
  
  ## Critical Issues Fixed:
  1. ✅ Replace text-based contact_name/contact_email in deals with proper foreign keys
  2. ✅ Create missing companies and contacts from legacy text data
  3. ✅ Establish proper referential integrity
  4. ✅ Populate new relationship tables with historical data
  5. ✅ Maintain data integrity during transition
  
  ## Migration Strategy:
  - Phase 1: Data consistency validation and preparation
  - Phase 2: Create missing companies from legacy deal data
  - Phase 3: Create missing contacts from legacy deal data
  - Phase 4: Update deals table with proper foreign key relationships
  - Phase 5: Populate new relationship tables with historical data
  - Phase 6: Data validation and cleanup
  
  ## EXECUTION TIME ESTIMATES:
  - Phase 1 (Data Analysis): ~30 seconds
  - Phase 2 (Company Creation): ~45 seconds
  - Phase 3 (Contact Creation): ~60 seconds
  - Phase 4 (Relationship Updates): ~90 seconds
  - Phase 5 (Historical Data Population): ~120 seconds
  - Phase 6 (Validation & Cleanup): ~45 seconds
  - Total Estimated Time: ~6 minutes
