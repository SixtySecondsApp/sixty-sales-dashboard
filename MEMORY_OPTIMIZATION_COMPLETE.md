## üéØ Immediate Actions Required

1. **Fix TypeScript Build Errors**
   ```bash
   # Files to fix:
   - src/tests/reconciliation/phase2-reconciliation-engine.test.ts
   - src/tests/reconciliation/react-hooks.test.ts
   ```

2. **Remove Console.log from Render**
   ```typescript
   // src/pages/companies/CompanyProfile.tsx:33
   // Move console.log to useEffect or remove
   ```

3. **Deploy Memory Monitor**
   ```bash
   make deploy-production
   make monitor-memory
   ```

## üìà Monitoring & Maintenance

### Real-Time Monitoring
- Memory usage dashboard available at `/memory-monitor`
- Prometheus metrics at `:9090/metrics`
- Grafana dashboards at `:3000`

### Automated Alerts
- Warning at 80% memory usage
- Critical at 90% memory usage
- Memory leak detection (>10MB/hour growth)
- Performance regression alerts

### Maintenance Schedule
- Weekly memory audits
- Monthly performance reviews
- Quarterly optimization assessments

## üöÄ Deployment Commands

```bash
# Run memory tests
npm run test:memory:framework

# Build with optimizations
npm run build:production

# Deploy to production
make deploy-production

# Monitor memory
make monitor-memory

# Emergency rollback
