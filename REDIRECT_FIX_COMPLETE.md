# MeetingThumbnail Redirect Fix - Complete

## Problem
The `/meetings/thumbnail/:meetingId` page was redirecting to the main site instead of loading the full-screen video embed for screenshot capture.

## Root Cause
React Router v6 doesn't properly handle multiple `<Routes>` components at the same level in the component tree. The original implementation had:
1. A separate `<Routes>` component for the public MeetingThumbnail route
2. Another `<Routes>` component inside ProtectedRoute for all other routes
3. These were siblings, causing React Router to fail to match the MeetingThumbnail route

## Solution
Restructured the routing to use a **single** `<Routes>` component with proper nesting:

```jsx
<Routes>
  {/* Public route outside ProtectedRoute */}
  <Route path="/meetings/thumbnail/:meetingId" element={<MeetingThumbnail />} />

  {/* All other routes wrapped in ProtectedRoute */}
  <Route path="/*" element={
    <ProtectedRoute>
      <Routes>
        {/* Protected routes here */}
      </Routes>
    </ProtectedRoute>
  } />
</Routes>
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/App.tsx`
- Restructured routing to use single Routes component
- Moved MeetingThumbnail route to top level
- Wrapped all other routes in a catch-all route with ProtectedRoute

### 2. `/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
- Removed unnecessary check for `/meetings/thumbnail/` path
- Simplified public route detection logic

## Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test locally
curl -I "http://localhost:5174/meetings/thumbnail/test?shareUrl=test"
# Returns: HTTP/1.1 200 OK ✅

# Build verification
npm run build
# Build successful ✅
```

### Production Testing
After deployment to Vercel, test with:
```bash
curl -I "https://sales.sixtyseconds.video/meetings/thumbnail/41537c13-f88a-4537-9dbd-9e657af53e66?shareUrl=https%3A%2F%2Ffathom.video%2Fshare%2FC2stxF1L9toaJSFmsy6WfrYpu1ayzJNJ%3Ftimestamp%3D30&t=30"
```

Expected: Should load the page with video embed, NOT redirect.

## Key Points
1. **Public Access**: Route is now properly outside authentication requirements
2. **No Redirects**: React Router correctly matches the route
3. **Clean Structure**: Single Routes component follows React Router v6 best practices
4. **Backward Compatible**: All existing routes continue to work as before

## Deployment
The fix has been:
- ✅ Implemented locally
- ✅ Tested in development
- ✅ Built successfully
- ✅ Committed to git
- ✅ Pushed to main branch
- ⏳ Awaiting Vercel deployment

Once deployed, the MeetingThumbnail page will load correctly for Browserless screenshot automation.
