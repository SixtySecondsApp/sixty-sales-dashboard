## About 60

60 is a **post-call** sales intelligence platform that syncs with Fathom after your calls end. It automatically generates AI summaries, extracts action items, drafts proposals, and gives you semantic search across every conversation. All your deals and pipeline in one place.

**Key distinction:** 60 does NOT listen live to your calls. It processes recordings AFTER the call ends, turning transcripts into actionable outputs within minutes.

### FULL SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:20]**

You just got off a great sales call. Prospect loved the demo. They want a proposal by tomorrow.

But you also have three bugs to fix, a investor update to write, and your co-founder needs you on a product decision in twenty minutes.

So you scribble some notes on a napkin, tell yourself you'll write that proposal tonight, and move on.

Sound familiar?

**[AGITATE - 0:20-0:50]**

Here's what happens next. That napkin gets lost. Tonight turns into tomorrow. Tomorrow turns into "I'll do it this weekend."

By the time you finally send that proposal, they've gone cold. Or worse—they've signed with someone who followed up faster.

This is the founder tax nobody talks about. You're not losing deals because you can't sell. You're losing them because you're doing seventeen other jobs at the same time.

Your CRM is a graveyard of "meant to follow up" deals. Your pipeline is a fiction you update once a month before board meetings. And every lost deal is revenue you desperately needed.

**[PAIN-TO-SOLUTION BRIDGE - 0:50-1:10]**

What if every call just... handled itself?

What if the moment you hung up, the summary was already written. Action items already captured. A proposal draft already waiting for you. Follow-up already scheduled.

Not magic. Not another thing on your to-do list. Just done.

**[INTRODUCE 60 - 1:10-1:30]**

That's 60.

60 syncs with your call recordings and processes them the moment you're done. AI reads the transcript, extracts what matters, and does the admin you hate.

Summaries in seconds. Proposals generated automatically. Smart follow-up reminders. Your entire pipeline in one place. And you can search any conversation instantly—"What did they say about budget?" Done.

**[VALUE STACK - 1:30-1:45]**

You're not getting a transcription tool. You're getting a post-call command center.

AI summaries that actually capture what happened. Action items you can trust. Proposals based on what your prospect actually said. Semantic search across every conversation you've ever had. And a pipeline that updates itself.

**[TRANSFORMATION - 1:45-1:55]**

Stop playing admin. Start closing deals. Get your evenings back.

Build the product. Let 60 handle the sales busywork.

## VSL 2: Sales Rep Pain

**Duration:** 2 minutes (~480 words)  
**Target:** Individual SDRs, AEs, sales professionals  
**Core Pain:** Admin is killing your quota and your sanity  
**Tone:** Frustrated, ambitious, then empowered

---

### FULL SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:20]**

You just crushed a demo. Prospect was nodding the whole time. Asked all the right questions. Said, "This looks perfect, send me a proposal."

That should be the best part of your day.

Instead, it's the start of four hours of admin. Notes. CRM updates. Proposal writing. Follow-up emails. Calendar juggling.

By the time you're done, you've missed three other opportunities.

**[AGITATE - 0:20-0:50]**

This is why you're stuck at eighty percent of quota.

Not because you can't sell. You can sell. You know you can sell.

You're stuck because you spend half your day NOT selling. Every hour on admin is an hour not on calls. Every evening catching up on CRM is an evening not recovering for tomorrow.

You didn't get into sales to be a data entry clerk. But that's what the job has become—fifty percent selling, fifty percent paperwork.

And here's the worst part: the admin doesn't even help you. Those notes you wrote last Tuesday? You can't find them. That CRM update? Nobody reads it except your manager looking for something to criticize.

**[PAIN-TO-SOLUTION BRIDGE - 0:50-1:10]**

Top performers aren't superhuman. They're not working twenty-hour days. They're not skipping lunch to update Salesforce.

They have systems. And the best system is now AI that does the busywork so you can do what you're actually good at—selling.

**[INTRODUCE 60 - 1:10-1:30]**

60 processes your calls the moment they end.

It reads the transcript, writes your summary, extracts action items, drafts your proposal, and updates your pipeline. Automatically. Before you've even stood up from your desk.

You finish the call. The work is done.

**[VALUE STACK - 1:30-1:45]**

You're not just getting transcription. Anyone can transcribe.

You're getting AI summaries that capture what actually matters. Action items you can trust. Proposals generated from what your prospect said—not a generic template. Semantic search across every conversation. And a CRM that finally works for you, not against you.

**[TRANSFORMATION - 1:45-1:55]**

More calls. More closes. More commission.

Less admin. Less stress. Less Sunday-night-dread.

This is how the top one percent sells. Now it's your turn.

**[CONFIDENT CTA - 1:55-2:00]**

Join the waitlist. Be first when we launch.

**Alternative Hooks to Test:**

2. "Last month I spent 47 hours on admin. I know because I tracked it. That's more than a full work week—gone."
3. "My manager thinks I have a selling problem. I have an admin problem."

## VSL 3: The New Way (Paradigm Shift)

**Duration:** 2 minutes (~480 words)  
**Target:** Forward-thinking sales professionals, early adopters  
**Core Pain:** The old way of sales is exhausting and dying  
**Tone:** Bold, visionary, slightly provocative, then inspiring

---

Sales Reps who are crushing quota right now aren't working harder. They're not staying later. They're not some special breed of sales superhuman.

They're using AI to eliminate the fifty percent of their job that isn't actually selling.

While you spend two hours writing post-call notes, they've already sent the proposal and moved on to the next opportunity. While you're digging through your CRM trying to find what a prospect said three months ago, they're searching their entire conversation history in seconds.

The gap isn't closing. It's widening.

**[THE SHIFT - 0:50-1:10]**

Meeting intelligence isn't optional anymore. It's not a "nice to have." It's not something for enterprise companies with big budgets.

It's the new baseline. The new minimum viable toolkit for anyone serious about sales.

And if you're not using it, you're not just missing out. You're actively falling behind. Every day.

**[INTRODUCE 60 - 1:10-1:30]**

60 is the AI sales partner built for how you actually work.

You finish your call. 60 processes the recording. Within minutes, you have an AI summary, action items extracted, a proposal draft ready to customize, and your pipeline updated.

Everything except closing. That's still you.

**[VALUE STACK - 1:30-1:45]**

AI-powered summaries that capture what matters, not transcription noise. Automatic action items so nothing slips. Proposal generation in seconds, based on what your prospect actually said. Semantic search across every conversation you've ever had—find anything instantly.

And your entire pipeline, all your deals, in one place that actually helps you sell.

**[FUTURE STATE - 1:45-1:55]**

Imagine finishing every call with the admin already done.

Imagine having four extra hours a day to actually sell. Imagine never losing a deal because a follow-up slipped.

That's not the future. That's 60. And it's here now.

**[CONFIDENT CTA - 1:55-2:00]**

Early access is limited. Early adopters get the edge.

- 0:10 - "It's 2025."
- 0:40 - "The Gap Is Widening"
- 1:05 - "The New Baseline"
- 1:50 - "The Admin Is Already Done"

**Alternative Hooks to Test:**
1. "The best salespeople in 2025 won't type a single meeting note."
2. "AI won't replace salespeople. Salespeople using AI will replace salespeople who don't."
3. "Your competitor's secret weapon isn't their product. It's their process."

## Ad 1: The Lost Deal Horror Story

**Duration:** 35-40 seconds  
**Platform:** Meta, YouTube pre-roll  
**Tone:** Storytelling, relatable regret, then hopeful

---

### FULL SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

I lost a fifty thousand pound deal last quarter.

Not to a competitor. To my own inbox.

**[STORY - 0:05-0:20]**

Great call. They loved the demo. Asked for a proposal.

But I had six other calls that day. Proposal got pushed to tomorrow. Tomorrow got pushed to the weekend. By the time I followed up—five days later—they'd already signed with someone faster.

Fifty thousand. Gone. Not because I couldn't sell. Because I couldn't keep up.

**[SOLUTION - 0:20-0:32]**

60 processes your calls the moment they end.

Summary written. Proposal drafted. Follow-up scheduled. Before you've even hung up.

**[CTA - 0:32-0:38]**

Never lose a deal to admin again.

## Ad 2: 4PM Friday (Lifestyle)

**Duration:** 35-40 seconds  
**Platform:** Meta, Instagram  
**Tone:** Aspirational, calm, slightly provocative contrast

---

### FULL SCRIPT

**[HOOK - 0:00-0:05]**

It's four PM on Friday.

Your deals are updated. Your proposals are sent. You're logging off.

**[PAIN CONTRAST - 0:05-0:18]**

That's not reality for most sales reps.

Most reps spend Friday evenings catching up on CRM. Sundays dreading Monday. Sacrificing weekends just to stay afloat.

That's not a career. That's a trap.

**[SOLUTION - 0:18-0:30]**

60 handles the admin the moment your call ends.

Summaries. Proposals. Pipeline updates. Done automatically. So you can actually live your life.

**[CTA - 0:30-0:38]**

Sell more. Work less. Get your weekends back.

Join the waitlist. Link below.

### PRODUCTION NOTES

**Visual Cues:**
- Open on someone closing laptop, golden hour lighting
- Quick flash to contrast: rep at desk at night, stressed

But you can't be fast when you're drowning in admin. You can't outpace someone whose AI does the busywork.

**[SOLUTION - 0:15-0:28]**

60 processes your calls the moment they end.

Summaries. Proposals. Action items. Pipeline updates. All automatic. All within minutes.

Your AI sales partner that handles everything except closing.

While you're thinking about it, someone else is signing up.

Join the waitlist. Get the edge.
