# 20 LinkedIn Posts for 60 Waitlist

Personal posts from Andrew's perspective as a founder who did founder-led sales for 10 years, built a system that works, and now helps revenue leaders and their teams do the same.

## Post 1: The £60K Wake-Up Call

I lost a £60,000 deal because I forgot to send an email. :man-facepalming:

Not a cold prospect. A warm one. Great meeting. They asked me to send a proposal.

I said "by end of day."

Then I got busy. Client work. Team stuff. The hundred other things I was juggling. The proposal sat in my drafts.

Two weeks later, I remembered.

They'd already signed with a competitor.

That was my breaking point.

I realised I wasn't bad at sales. I was drowning in everything that happens after the sales call.

So I built an AI system that never forgets.

60 sends follow-ups automatically. Generates proposals in 60 seconds. Handles the admin that was costing me deals.

If you've ever lost revenue to your own inbox, I built this for you.

## Post 2: 10 Years of Founder-Led Sales

For 10 years, I was the sales team.

CEO. Founder. And the only person bringing in new business.

No playbook. No process. No predictability.

Just me, trying to juggle client delivery, team management, and somehow still finding time to sell.

I tracked my time one week. Here's what I found:

→ 6 hours writing proposals
→ 5 hours prepping for meetings
→ 4 hours on forgotten follow-ups
→ 3 hours responding to inquiries
→ 2 hours updating the CRM

20 hours. On admin. Not selling.

That's when I decided to build 60.

Now my team follows a proven system. And I've got my time back.

## Post 3: The Revenue Leader's Confession

I need to be honest about something.

I never set out to be a salesperson. :see_no_evil:

I started a business. Sales was just one of the hats I had to wear.

For 10 years.

→ New inquiries sat unanswered for days (I was busy with clients)
→ Follow-ups only happened if I set 4 reminders
→ Proposals took hours because I'd forget what we discussed
→ Meeting prep meant Googling them 2 minutes before the call

I grew the business in spite of myself.

So I asked: What if I could build a system that handled all the bits I was terrible at?

That's 60.

It captures what happens in your meetings and handles all the admin automatically.

You focus on closing deals. It handles the follow-through.

If you're a revenue leader wearing too many hats, I built this for us: use60.com/waitlist

## Post 4: The 11 PM Proposal

Last year, I finished a proposal at 11:47 PM.

My family was asleep. I'd missed dinner. Again.

The prospect had asked for it "by end of week."

It was Thursday night.

I remember sitting there thinking: I'm not working late because I'm building something great. I'm working late because I can't keep up with admin.

I have a team of 10. I should be leading them. Not writing proposals at midnight.

That was the moment I decided to build 60.

Now proposals take 60 seconds. The AI writes them from your meeting notes.

Revenue leaders using 60 aren't working nights anymore. They're focused on what actually grows the business.

If you're tired of choosing between family and follow-ups, join the waitlist: use60.com/waitlist

You didn't build a career to work at midnight.

## Post 5: Why Revenue Leaders Are Drowning

Here's a truth nobody talks about:

Most people responsible for revenue spend more time on admin than actually selling. :thinking_face:

Whether you're a founder, sales leader, or running a revenue team - the same problems hit everyone:

→ Proposals take hours
→ Follow-ups slip through the cracks
→ Meeting prep eats your mornings
→ CRM updates never happen

I did founder-led sales for 10 years. Built a team of 10 people. And still couldn't escape the admin treadmill.

Until I built 60.

Now I have a system. A process. Predictability.

My team follows it. I don't have to be in every deal anymore.

## Post 6: The Monday Morning Disaster

Every Monday, I had the same problem. :weary:

3 inquiries from the weekend. All sitting in my inbox.

But I had a team standup. Client calls. A hundred fires to put out.

By the time I responded Tuesday afternoon, two had already booked with competitors.

Not because they liked those competitors more.

Because those competitors responded first.

I was losing revenue before I even had a chance to sell.

That's why 60 responds to inquiries instantly. Even when you're busy.

Revenue teams using it are capturing leads they used to lose.

## Post 7: What 10 Years Taught Me

After 10 years of founder-led sales, I finally figured out what was broken.

It wasn't my pitch. It wasn't my product. It wasn't my pricing.

It was the follow-through.

Same three problems, every single year:

1. I'd forget to follow up
2. Proposals took forever
3. I never had time to prep for meetings

I wasn't failing at sales. I was failing at admin.

So I built a system that handles all of it automatically.

→ Follow-ups sent in 5 minutes (not 48 hours)
→ Proposals in 60 seconds (not 2-3 hours)
→ Meeting prep done automatically (not 30 minutes of scrambling)

Now my team runs this system. And it works.

## Post 8: The Follow-Up That Saved a Deal

True story from last month: :sweat_smile:

Great discovery call on Tuesday. Prospect was ready to move.

Wednesday: client emergency, team issues, inbox exploding.

Thursday: completely forgot about the follow-up.

Friday morning, I woke up in a panic.

But 60 had already sent it. Tuesday night. Automatically.

The prospect replied Thursday: "When can we start?"

I almost lost that deal. The system saved it.

That's the difference between "I should follow up" and "it's already done."

## Post 9: From Chaos to System

For 10 years, my sales "process" was chaos.

Leads came in. I'd respond when I could. Follow-ups happened... sometimes.

No wonder growth was unpredictable.

Now I have a system. And the difference is night and day. :raised_hands:

→ Proposals: 2 hours → 60 seconds
→ Follow-ups: whenever I remembered → automatic
→ Meeting prep: 30 minutes of scrambling → automatic
→ CRM updates: never → automatic

My team follows this process. It's predictable. It's scalable.

I finally have revenue growth that doesn't depend on heroics.

## Post 10: The Competitor Who Beat Me

I lost a deal last year to a competitor with a worse product.

Worse features. Higher price. Less experience.

But they followed up faster. :man-shrugging:

While I was putting out fires, they'd already sent their proposal.

While I was planning my follow-up, they'd already called twice.

Speed beat quality.

That's when I realised: revenue leaders lose deals because we're busy, not because we're bad at sales.

60 sends follow-ups in 5 minutes. Proposals in 60 seconds.

Even when you're juggling everything else.

## Post 12: 9 Months of Building

For the last 9 months, I've been building 60. :alarm_clock:

8 hours during the day running my business. Then every evening until midnight. Most weekends too.

Learning how to use AI to build applications. Working with my dev team. Shipping features.

But here's the thing - I never missed a family dinner. Never skipped a social. I made it work.

Because I knew what it felt like to be on the other side.

10 years of staying late finishing proposals. Missing moments because of "just one more follow-up." Spending Sundays catching up on sales admin.

I was done with that life. So I built a system to make sure no one else has to live it.

I didn't build 60 to start another company.

I built it because I was desperate for something that actually worked.

Now other revenue leaders are using it. And they're getting their lives back too.

## Post 13: The Meeting Prep I Used to Hate

I used to spend 30 minutes prepping for every 30-minute sales call.

But when you're responsible for revenue AND running a business, you've got 50 other things demanding attention.

So I'd scramble. Google them 2 minutes before. Hope I remembered what we discussed last time. :stopwatch:

Now 60 sends me a Slack message before every meeting:

→ Who they are and what they care about
→ What we discussed last time
→ What I promised to do
→ What questions to ask

All the prep work, done automatically.

That's hours back every week. Hours to spend on what actually grows the business.

## Post 14: The ADHD Sales Problem

I have ADHD. And I'm great on sales calls. :unamused:

Like, really great. Fully present. Engaged. Asking the right questions. Building rapport.

Then the call ends.

And my brain has already moved on to the next thing.

Log the notes? Update the CRM? Fill in the custom fields?

Not happening.

Here's the thing every salesperson knows: if it's not in the CRM, it doesn't exist.

So half my deals... didn't exist. At least not to anyone else on my team.

I wasn't lazy. I just couldn't follow a manual process to save my life.

That's why I built 60.

Call ends → notes logged → stage updated → next steps scheduled. Automatically.

My ADHD brain gets to move on. The CRM stays up to date. My team has full visibility.

If your CRM is a ghost town because you can't stick to the process, this will fix it: use60.com/waitlist

## Post 15: From Unpredictable to Predictable

For 10 years, I had no idea where next month's revenue was coming from.

Some months were great. Others were terrifying.

No pipeline visibility. No follow-up system. No predictability. :chart_with_upwards_trend:

Now I have a process that works:

→ Every inquiry gets an instant response
→ Every meeting gets an automatic follow-up
→ Every proposal goes out in 60 seconds
→ Every deal is tracked without manual updates

My team runs this system. I finally have predictable revenue.

## Post 16: The Feature Nobody Wanted

I spent 6 weeks building a feature nobody used. :man-facepalming:

Beautiful dashboard. Analytics. Insights.

Showed it to revenue leaders in our beta.

"Cool. But can it just send me a Slack message?"

They didn't want fancy. They wanted helpful.

Revenue leaders don't have time to learn new dashboards. They need things done automatically.

So I deleted 6 weeks of work and built what they actually needed.

Now 60 is simple:

→ Your calls happen
→ Admin work happens automatically
→ You focus on revenue

No dashboards to learn. No workflows to configure.

Just less admin, more deals.

## Post 17: What Your Time Is Really Worth

As a revenue leader, your time is your most valuable asset.

Every hour you spend on sales admin is an hour not spent on:

→ Closing deals
→ Leading your team
→ Building relationships
→ Growing the business

I spent 10+ hours a week on sales admin for years.

That's 500+ hours a year. Doing work that doesn't close deals.

I built 60 because I was tired of wasting my most valuable resource.

Revenue leaders using it are getting 10+ hours back weekly. That's 500+ hours a year to spend on what actually matters.

## Post 18: The Sunday Night Inbox

I used to spend every Sunday night in my inbox. :pensive:

Catching up on follow-ups I forgot.
Writing proposals I promised on Friday.
Prepping for Monday's meetings.

Not because I loved working Sundays.

Because I was drowning during the week.

Running a team of 10. Managing clients. Trying to grow revenue. Sales admin kept slipping.

Now 60 handles it all automatically. During business hours.

I haven't opened my laptop on a Sunday in 4 months.

## Post 19: The 60-Second Proposal (And The Criticism)

Last week, I sent a proposal 47 seconds after hanging up with a prospect. :rocket:

They replied immediately: "That was fast."

We closed the deal 3 days later.

Now, I'll be honest. I've also had someone say it was "too fast" - they assumed it was AI and didn't read it properly.

Fair point. But here's the thing:

That proposal was better than anything I would've written myself. And if I'd done it manually? I'd still be using AI line by line to help me write it anyway. It just would've taken a day instead of 60 seconds.

Old me would've sent that proposal 3 days later. After client work. After team stuff. After everything else.

By then, they would've talked to competitors. Momentum would've died.

60 generates proposals from your meeting notes. In 60 seconds.

Custom. Professional. Better than I could write myself.

Speed wins. And the quality is there too.

## Post 20: Why I'm Sharing This

I've been building 60 for 8 months.

Every post I write is a little scary. :sweat:

What if people judge me for losing that £60K deal?
What if they think I'm just selling something?
What if this whole thing fails?

But I keep sharing because I know I'm not alone.

There are thousands of revenue leaders right now:

→ Drowning in sales admin
→ Losing deals to forgotten follow-ups
→ Spending nights and weekends catching up
→ Growing revenue without any predictable system

I was that person for 10 years.

Now I have a team that follows a proven process. And I'm helping other revenue leaders do the same.

If you're ready to 10x your output and build a real sales system, join the waitlist: use60.com/waitlist

600+ revenue leaders already waiting. Early access starts soon.

Let's stop doing admin and start closing.
