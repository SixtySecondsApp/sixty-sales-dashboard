# Thumbnail Generation - Debugging Next Steps

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Deployed**: Function is live with enhanced logging
‚ùå **Testing**: Still failing - need to check logs for root cause

## What We've Done

1. ‚úÖ Simplified Browserless script
2. ‚úÖ Removed `ONLY_BROWSERLESS` restriction  
3. ‚úÖ Removed `DISABLE_THIRD_PARTY_SCREENSHOTS` restriction
4. ‚úÖ Added detailed logging throughout
5. ‚úÖ Deployed multiple times with fixes

## Configuration Verified

```
‚úÖ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - Set
‚úÖ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - Set
‚úÖ AWS_S3_BUCKET - Set (user-upload)
‚úÖ AWS_S3_FOLDER - Set (fathom-screenshots)
‚úÖ AWS_REGION - Set (eu-west-2)
‚úÖ BROWSERLESS_TOKEN - Set
‚úÖ BROWSERLESS_URL - Set
```

## Next Step: CHECK THE LOGS

**YOU MUST check the Supabase logs to see the actual error:**

## What to Look For in Logs

### 1. Microlink Errors
```
Look for:
- "üì∏ Attempting thumbnail capture with Microlink"
- "‚ùå Microlink failed" - check what error follows
- "‚è±Ô∏è Microlink...timed out"
- HTTP status codes from Microlink API
```

### 2. S3 Upload Errors
```
Look for:
- "üì§ Starting S3 upload"
- "‚ùå AWS credentials missing!"
- "Error uploading to S3:"
- S3Client connection errors
```

### 3. Configuration Issues
```
Look for:
- "Config: skipThirdParty=..."
- "üì∏ Skipping third-party services"
- Environment variable values
```

## Likely Issues

### Issue 1: Microlink Rate Limit
**Symptoms**: "429" or "rate limit" in logs
**Solution**: Wait a few minutes, or sign up for Microlink paid tier

### Issue 2: AWS S3 Credentials Invalid
**Symptoms**: "Access Denied" or "SignatureDoesNotMatch"
**Solution**: Verify AWS credentials in Supabase secrets are correct

### Issue 3: S3 Bucket Permissions
**Symptoms**: "Access Denied" when uploading
**Solution**: Check IAM policy allows `s3:PutObject` on the bucket

### Issue 4: Microlink Timeout
**Symptoms**: Logs show "timeout:microlink"
**Solution**: Fathom pages taking too long to load

## Alternative Solutions

If all screenshot services are failing, here are alternatives:

### Option 1: Use Fathom's og:image (If Available)
The code already tries this, but Fathom may not provide og:image for all videos.

### Option 2: Use Placeholder Thumbnails
Already implemented as final fallback - generates colored squares with initials.

### Option 3: Sign Up for ScreenshotOne
- Cost: $19/month for 5,000 screenshots  
- More reliable than free tier Microlink
- Sign up: https://screenshotone.com
- Set secret: `supabase secrets set SCREENSHOTONE_API_KEY=your_key`

### Option 4: Fix Browserless
If you want to use Browserless (already configured):
1. Get the actual token from Supabase vault
2. Test it directly: 
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://chrome.browserless.io/screenshot?token=YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "https://example.com"}' \
     --output test.png
   ```
3. If that works, the issue is in our Playwright script
4. If that fails, the token is invalid

## Quick Test Commands

### Test Microlink Directly
```bash
curl "https://api.microlink.io/?url=https://example.com&screenshot=true&meta=false"
```

### Test AWS S3 Upload (from your machine)
```bash
# Get credentials from .env file
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your_key"
AWS_SECRET="your_secret"

# Try uploading a test file
aws s3 cp test.jpg s3://user-upload/fathom-screenshots/test.jpg \
  --region eu-west-2
```

## What The Logs Will Tell Us

Once you check the logs, you'll see ONE of these:

1. **"üì∏ Attempting thumbnail capture with Microlink"** ‚Üí Microlink is trying
   - If followed by ‚ùå, check the error message
   - Could be rate limit, timeout, or API error

2. **"üì§ Starting S3 upload"** ‚Üí Screenshot captured, uploading
   - If followed by ‚ùå, it's an AWS issue
   - Check credentials and permissions

3. **"‚ùå AWS credentials missing!"** ‚Üí Environment variables not set properly
   - Redeploy function or check secrets

4. **"Config: skipThirdParty=true"** ‚Üí Still blocking third-party services
   - Environment variable change didn't take effect
   - Redeploy again

## Action Required

1. **Open the logs**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb/functions/generate-video-thumbnail/logs

2. **Find the latest request** (should be timestamped within last few minutes)

3. **Look for the error messages** listed above

4. **Share the error** or tell me what you see, and I can provide the exact fix

## Files Changed

- `supabase/functions/generate-video-thumbnail/index.ts` - Enhanced with detailed logging
- Environment variables - Removed restrictive flags

## Current Function Behavior

```
Request arrives
  ‚Üì
Try Microlink (free tier)
  ‚Üì (if fails)
Try ScreenshotOne (if API key set)
  ‚Üì (if fails)
Try ApiFlash (if API key set)
  ‚Üì (if fails)
Try Browserless (if configured)
  ‚Üì (if fails)
Try og:image scraping
  ‚Üì (if all fail)
Return error: "Failed to capture video thumbnail - all methods exhausted"
```

**The logs will show you exactly which step is failing and why.**
