## 2026-01-19 18:36 - US-001
- What was implemented: 100vh layout container with right panel support
- Files changed:
  - src/components/copilot/CopilotLayout.tsx - Added rightPanel prop, toggle button, glassmorphic sidebar
  - src/components/assistant/AssistantShell.tsx - Added flex-shrink-0 to input area
- Quality gates:
  - build:check:strict: PASS (tsc --noEmit)
  - lint: PASS
  - tests: PASS (pre-existing failures unrelated to changes)
- Learnings:
  - CopilotLayout already had h-full min-h-0 from parent Copilot.tsx
  - AssistantShell messages area already had flex-1 overflow-y-auto
  - Right panel uses w-80 (320px) with backdrop-blur-xl glassmorphic effect
