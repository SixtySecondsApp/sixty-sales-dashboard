# Activity Filtering Enhancement Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented comprehensive filtering capabilities for the activities page in the sales dashboard, providing users with the ability to filter activities by multiple criteria including date, activity type, and various sub-types.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Activity Filters Hook (`src/lib/hooks/useActivityFilters.ts`)
- **Extended Filter Types**: Added type definitions for all filter categories
- **Sub-type Support**: Added support for sale types, meeting types, and outbound types
- **Comprehensive Filtering**: Includes filters for:
  - Activity Type (`sale`, `outbound`, `meeting`, `proposal`)
  - Activity Status (`completed`, `pending`, `cancelled`, `no_show`)  
  - Activity Priority (`high`, `medium`, `low`)
  - Sales Rep filtering
  - Client name filtering
  - Amount range filtering (min/max)
  - Date range filtering
  - Search across multiple fields

### 2. Sub-Type Filtering
- **Sale Types**: One-off, Subscription, Lifetime
- **Meeting Types**: Discovery Call, Product Demo, Follow-up, Demo, Other
- **Outbound Types**: Phone Call, Email, LinkedIn, Other

### 3. Comprehensive Filter UI (`src/components/SalesTable.tsx`)
- **Collapsible Filter Panel**: Toggle-able advanced filters section
- **Search Functionality**: Global search across activities, clients, and details
- **Date Range Presets**: Quick selection for common date ranges
- **Dynamic Sub-Type Filtering**: Sub-type options appear based on selected main activity type
- **Amount Range Filtering**: Min/max amount inputs for revenue filtering
- **Multi-Field Filtering**: Simultaneous filtering across all available criteria

### 4. Enhanced Filtering Logic
- **Comprehensive Activity Filtering**: Updated `filteredActivities` logic to handle:
  - Date range matching
  - Type and sub-type matching (based on details field)
  - Sales rep matching
  - Client name matching
  - Status and priority matching
  - Amount range validation
  - Full-text search across multiple fields
- **Real-time Filtering**: All filters applied immediately as users make selections
- **Filter State Persistence**: Maintains filter state during navigation

### 5. User Experience Features
- **Active Filter Indicator**: Shows when filters are active with count badge
- **Clear All Filters**: One-click reset of all applied filters
- **Filter Summary**: Visual indication of active filtering
- **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices

## Technical Implementation

### Filter Architecture
- **Zustand State Management**: Centralized filter state management
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all filter types
- **Performance Optimized**: Memoized filtering logic for large datasets

### Filtering Capabilities
The new system allows users to filter activities by:

1. **Date & Time**
   - Custom date ranges
   - Preset date ranges (Today, This Week, This Month, etc.)
   
2. **Activity Classification**
   - Primary type (Sale, Outbound, Meeting, Proposal)
   - Sub-types based on primary selection
   - Status (Completed, Pending, Cancelled, No Show)
   - Priority (High, Medium, Low)

3. **Business Context**
   - Sales representative
   - Client/company name
   - Amount ranges for revenue analysis

4. **Content Search**
   - Full-text search across activity details
   - Client name search
   - Sales rep search

### Sub-Type Integration
Sub-types are intelligently matched against the `details` field of activities, allowing for:
- **Sale Type Recognition**: Identifies "one-off", "subscription", "lifetime" in activity details
- **Meeting Type Recognition**: Matches meeting types like "Discovery Call", "Demo", "Follow-up"
- **Outbound Type Recognition**: Identifies contact methods like "Call", "Email", "LinkedIn"

## Usage Instructions
