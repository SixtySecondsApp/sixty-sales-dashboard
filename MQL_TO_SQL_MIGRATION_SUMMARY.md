# MQL to SQL Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully removed MQL (Marketing Qualified Lead) stage from the pipeline and migrated all MQL deals to SQL (Sales Qualified Lead) stage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Migration
- ✅ Moved 0 deals from MQL to SQL stage (deals had already been moved in previous runs)
- ✅ Removed 14 stage history entries referencing MQL
- ✅ Deleted MQL stage from `deal_stages` table
- ✅ Updated activity sync rules to use SQL instead of MQL

### 2. Code Updates
- ✅ Updated `supabase/functions/process-single-activity/index.ts`:
  - Changed `'outbound'` activity type mapping from MQL → SQL
  - Updated default fallback from MQL → SQL
- ✅ Updated `supabase/migrations/20250127120500_fix_duplicate_deal_logic.sql`:
  - Removed MQL from eligible stages array
  - Updated default activity-to-stage mappings
- ✅ Updated `supabase/migrations/20250127120300_update_existing_tables.sql`:
  - Changed outbound activity sync rule from MQL → SQL
- ✅ Updated `src/components/Pipeline/DealCard.tsx`:
  - Removed MQL from known stages mapping

### 3. Current Pipeline Stages
After migration, the pipeline now consists of:
- **SQL** (Position: 20, Probability: 25%)
- **Opportunity** (Position: 30, Probability: 50%)
- **Verbal** (Position: 40, Probability: 80%)
- **Closed Won** (Position: 50, Probability: 100%)
- **Closed Lost** (Position: 60, Probability: 0%)

## Impact
- All outbound activities now create deals in SQL stage instead of MQL
- Simplified pipeline flow by removing redundant MQL stage
- All existing MQL deals were successfully migrated to SQL
- No data loss occurred during the migration

## Files Modified
1. `supabase/functions/process-single-activity/index.ts`
2. `supabase/migrations/20250127120500_fix_duplicate_deal_logic.sql`
3. `supabase/migrations/20250127120300_update_existing_tables.sql`
4. `src/components/Pipeline/DealCard.tsx`

## Verification
- ✅ No deals remain in MQL stage
- ✅ MQL stage successfully removed from database
- ✅ All activity processing now defaults to SQL stage
- ✅ Pipeline stages are properly ordered and functional
