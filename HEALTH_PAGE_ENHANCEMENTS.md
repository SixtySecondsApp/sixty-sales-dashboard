### 2. **Sales Rep Filtering** ✅

} else if (selectedUserId !== 'all') {
  filtered = filtered.filter((s) => s.user_id === selectedUserId);
}
```

**UI Component** (lines 216-231):
```typescript
<select
  value={selectedUserId}
  onChange={(e) => setSelectedUserId(e.target.value)}
  className="px-3 py-2 rounded-lg border border-gray-300 dark:border-gray-600..."
>
  <option value="me">My Deals</option>
  <option value="all">All Sales Reps</option>
  {users.map((user) => (
    <option key={user.id} value={user.id}>
      {user.first_name || user.last_name
        ? `${user.first_name || ''} ${user.last_name || ''}`.trim()
