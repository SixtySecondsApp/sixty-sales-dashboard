# Fix Meetings RLS Permission Error

## Problem
- Meetings are in the database but not showing in frontend
- Error: "permission denied for table users" (403)
- Frontend query trying to join meetings ‚Üí companies fails due to RLS policies

## Root Cause
The RLS (Row Level Security) policies on the `meetings` and `companies` tables are either:
1. Too restrictive or incorrectly configured
2. Trying to access `auth.users` table without proper permissions
3. Preventing the join between meetings and companies

## Solution

### Step 1: Apply RLS Fix

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

**File**: `FIX_MEETINGS_RLS.sql`

This SQL script will:
1. ‚úÖ Drop all existing problematic RLS policies
2. ‚úÖ Create clean, simple RLS policies for meetings
3. ‚úÖ Create clean, simple RLS policies for companies
4. ‚úÖ Create clean, simple RLS policies for meeting_action_items
5. ‚úÖ Add service role bypass for Edge Functions
6. ‚úÖ Enable proper SELECT permissions for joins

### Step 2: Verify the Fix

After running the SQL, test with this query:

```sql
-- Test as authenticated user
SELECT
  m.id,
  m.title,
  m.meeting_start,
  m.owner_user_id,
  c.name as company_name,
  c.domain as company_domain
FROM meetings m
LEFT JOIN companies c ON c.id = m.company_id
WHERE m.owner_user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY m.meeting_start DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Expected result: You should see your meetings with company data

### Step 3: Check Frontend

Refresh the frontend at `/meetings` - meetings should now load successfully.

## What Changed

### Before (Problematic)
```sql
-- Complex policies trying to access auth.users
CREATE POLICY "meetings_policy" ON meetings
  FOR SELECT USING (
    owner_user_id IN (
      SELECT id FROM auth.users WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### After (Fixed)
```sql
-- Simple, direct policies
CREATE POLICY "meetings_select_policy" ON meetings
  FOR SELECT USING (
    owner_user_id = auth.uid()
  );
```

## RLS Policy Structure

### Meetings Table
- `meetings_select_policy` - Users can view their own meetings
- `meetings_insert_policy` - Users can create meetings
- `meetings_update_policy` - Users can update their own meetings
- `meetings_delete_policy` - Users can delete their own meetings
- `meetings_service_role_all` - Service role (Edge Functions) has full access

### Companies Table
- `companies_select_policy` - Users can view companies they own
- `companies_insert_policy` - Users can create companies
- `companies_update_policy` - Users can update their own companies
- `companies_delete_policy` - Users can delete their own companies
- `companies_service_role_all` - Service role has full access

### Meeting Action Items Table
- `action_items_select_policy` - Users can view action items for their meetings
- `action_items_insert_policy` - Users can create action items for their meetings
- `action_items_update_policy` - Users can update action items for their meetings
- `action_items_delete_policy` - Users can delete action items for their meetings
- `action_items_service_role_all` - Service role has full access

## Verification Checklist

After applying the fix:

- [ ] Run `FIX_MEETINGS_RLS.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Verify policies created (query at end of SQL file)
- [ ] Test query to fetch meetings with company join
- [ ] Refresh frontend `/meetings` page
- [ ] Confirm meetings load without 403 errors
- [ ] Verify action items display correctly
- [ ] Check browser console for errors (should be clean)

## Expected Frontend Behavior

**Before Fix**:
```
‚ùå Failed to load resource: 403
‚ùå Error fetching meetings: permission denied for table users
‚ùå No meetings displayed
```

**After Fix**:
```
‚úÖ Meetings load successfully
‚úÖ Company names display correctly
‚úÖ Action items counts show
‚úÖ No console errors
```

## Troubleshooting

### If meetings still don't show:

1. **Check user is authenticated**:
```sql
SELECT auth.uid(); -- Should return your user ID
```

2. **Check meetings exist for your user**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM meetings WHERE owner_user_id = auth.uid();
```

3. **Check RLS is enabled**:
```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('meetings', 'companies', 'meeting_action_items');
```

4. **Verify policies exist**:
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('meetings', 'companies', 'meeting_action_items')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### If you get different errors:

- **"relation does not exist"**: Check table names are correct
- **"column does not exist"**: Verify `owner_user_id` exists in meetings table
- **"function auth.uid() does not exist"**: Check you're connected as authenticated user, not anon
