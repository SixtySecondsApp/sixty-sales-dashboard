# Foreign Key Constraint Fix - Test Plan

## Overview
This test plan verifies that the foreign key constraint fix works properly when creating proposal activities immediately after deal creation.

## Bug Description
**Issue**: Foreign key constraint violation when creating proposal activity immediately after deal creation due to race condition.
**Error Code**: 23503 (PostgreSQL foreign key violation)

## Fix Implementation
1. 500ms initial delay before creating proposal activity
2. Retry logic with 1000ms delay if foreign key error (23503) occurs
3. Graceful error handling if retry fails

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Test the isolated retry logic and error handling

### 2. Integration Tests
Test the complete flow from deal creation to proposal activity creation

### 3. End-to-End Tests
Test the complete user workflow including UI interactions

### 4. Race Condition Simulation Tests
Test various timing scenarios and database states

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Proposal activity creation succeeds after deal creation
- ✅ Retry logic activates when foreign key error occurs
- ✅ User experience remains smooth (no visible errors to user)
- ✅ Deal creation succeeds even if activity creation fails
- ✅ Proper error logging for debugging
- ✅ No memory leaks from setTimeout operations

## Test Environment Requirements
- PostgreSQL database with foreign key constraints enabled
- Supabase client configured
- Test data with valid deals and activities tables
- Ability to simulate database timing issues

## Risk Areas
- Race conditions between deal creation and activity creation
- Database transaction timing
- Network latency affecting API calls
- Browser performance affecting setTimeout reliability
