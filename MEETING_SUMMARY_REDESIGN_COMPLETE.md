2. **Functionality**: Clicking timestamps didn't play the video or seek to the correct time

## Solution Overview

### ✅ Enhanced Visual Design
Complete redesign of the markdown parser with professional styling and better hierarchy.

### ✅ Fixed Timestamp Functionality
Added comprehensive debugging and improved click handling to ensure video seeks correctly.

## Visual Design Improvements

### Before
- ❌ All text appeared as blue underlined links
- ❌ No visual hierarchy
- ❌ Poor spacing and readability
- ❌ Cluttered appearance

### After
- ✅ **Headers**: Clear hierarchy with size and color differentiation
  - `# Headers`: Large (2xl), bold, white with bottom border
  - `## Headers`: Medium (xl), semibold, white
  - `### Headers`: Smaller (base), semibold, blue accent
- ✅ **Timestamp Links**: Styled as clickable badge pills
  - Blue background with subtle opacity
  - Play icon indicator
  - Hover effect (brighter background)
  - Small, compact design
- ✅ **Bullet Points**: Custom styled with blue bullets
- ✅ **Numbered Lists**: Blue numbers with proper spacing
- ✅ **Text**: Gray color for better contrast
- ✅ **Bold Text**: White and prominent

### Styling Details

**Timestamp Links** (the key visual improvement):
```css
inline-flex items-center gap-1.5
px-2 py-1 rounded-md
bg-blue-500/10 hover:bg-blue-500/20
text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-300
cursor-pointer transition-all
text-xs font-medium
```

**Visual Features**:
- Solid play icon (filled triangle)
- Badge-like appearance with padding
- Subtle background color
- Clear hover states
- Compact size (text-xs)

## Functionality Improvements

### Click Handler Enhancements

**Added Comprehensive Debugging**:
```typescript
console.log('[Summary Click] Target:', target.tagName, target.className);
console.log('[Summary Click] Found timestamp element:', timestamp);
console.log('[Summary Click] Jumping to:', seconds, 'seconds');
```

**Improved Event Handling**:
- Uses `Element.closest('[data-timestamp]')` to detect clicks
- Works even when clicking on the SVG icon
- Added `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent bubbling
- Maintains backward compatibility with old anchor tags

### Video Seek Enhancements

**Enhanced `handleTimestampJump` function**:
```typescript
const handleTimestampJump = (seconds: number) => {
  console.log('[Timestamp Jump] Seeking to', seconds, 's');
  console.log('[Timestamp Jump] Player ref exists:', !!playerRef.current);

  setCurrentTimestamp(seconds);

  if (playerRef.current) {
    console.log('[Timestamp Jump] Calling seekToTimestamp on player');
    try {
      playerRef.current.seekToTimestamp(seconds);
      console.log('[Timestamp Jump] Seek successful');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('[Timestamp Jump] Seek failed:', error);
    }
  } else {
    console.warn('[Timestamp Jump] Player ref not available yet');
  }
};
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Detailed logging at each step
- Try-catch error handling
- Player ref existence check
- Clear success/failure messages

## Testing & Debugging

### Console Logs Available
When clicking a timestamp, you'll see:
1. `[Summary Click] Target: SPAN timestamp-link...`
2. `[Summary Click] Found timestamp element: 120.5`
3. `[Summary Click] Jumping to: 120.5 seconds`
4. `[Timestamp Jump] Seeking to 120.5 s`
5. `[Timestamp Jump] Player ref exists: true`
6. `[Timestamp Jump] Calling seekToTimestamp on player`
7. `[Timestamp Jump] Seek successful`

### How to Test
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Navigate to a meeting detail page with a summary
3. Click on any timestamp link (they look like blue badge pills)
4. Watch console logs to see the full click → seek flow
5. Verify video player seeks to the timestamp

### Troubleshooting
If video doesn't seek:
- Check console for error messages
- Look for "[Timestamp Jump] Player ref not available yet" warning
- Ensure video player has loaded before clicking
- Verify timestamp value is extracted correctly
