# Plan v002: Sales Activities and Pipeline Deals Reconciliation System
Created: 2025-08-17T20:15:00Z

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive reconciliation system to resolve data inconsistencies between sales activities and pipeline deals. This system will identify orphan records, duplicates, and missing relationships while providing both automatic and manual reconciliation tools.

## Current Situation Analysis

### Data Inconsistency Scenarios
1. **Orphan Activities**: Sales activities logged without creating corresponding pipeline deals
2. **Duplicate Records**: Both activity and deal exist for same sale on same day (should be merged)
3. **Orphan Deals**: Pipeline deals without corresponding activities (activity wasn't logged)

### Impact Assessment
- **Revenue Accuracy**: Inconsistent data affects MRR calculations and revenue reporting
- **Sales Tracking**: Incomplete pipeline visibility impacts sales forecasting
- **Data Integrity**: Orphan records create confusion and duplicate effort
- **Reporting**: Dashboard metrics may be inaccurate due to data gaps

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions, PostgreSQL
- **Data Processing**: SQL scripts with intelligent matching algorithms
- **UI Components**: Custom components extending existing design system
- **State Management**: React Query for data fetching and caching

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive reporting of all data discrepancies
2. **Automatic Reconciliation**: Smart matching and linking of related records
3. **Manual Reconciliation**: UI for handling uncertain matches and edge cases
4. **Data Cleanup**: Remove duplicates and validate data integrity
5. **Prevention System**: Hooks and validation to prevent future inconsistencies

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Process large datasets efficiently (>10,000 records)
2. **Data Safety**: Never delete data without explicit user confirmation
3. **Audit Trail**: Track all reconciliation actions for compliance
4. **Scalability**: System should handle growing data volumes
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface for complex data operations
