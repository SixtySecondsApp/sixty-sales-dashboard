# Fathom Sync - Comprehensive Test Plan

## Status: Ready for Testing
**Version Deployed**: v25 (all schema fixes applied)

---

## üéØ Test Objectives

Verify all 4 critical issues are resolved:
1. ‚úÖ Missing thumbnails (fixed - 100% coverage confirmed)
2. ‚è≥ Action items not syncing (fixed - pending verification)
3. ‚úÖ Duplicate attendees (fixed - 0 duplicates confirmed)
4. ‚è≥ Contact creation errors (fixed - pending full verification)

---

## üìã Pre-Test Checklist

- [ ] Edge Function v25 deployed successfully
- [ ] All schema fixes applied (contacts, activities tables)
- [ ] RLS policies updated for action items
- [ ] Shared utility files updated (primaryContactSelection.ts, companyMatching.ts)

---

## üß™ Test Procedure

### Step 1: Trigger Fresh Fathom Sync

Navigate to the Fathom integration settings in the application and trigger a manual sync.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Sync completes without errors
- All meetings imported successfully
- No console errors in browser or Edge Function logs

---

### Step 2: Verify Thumbnails (Already Confirmed Working)

Run this SQL query:

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_fathom_meetings,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN thumbnail_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as with_thumbnails,
  ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN thumbnail_url IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END)::numeric / COUNT(*)::numeric * 100, 1) as coverage_pct
FROM meetings
WHERE fathom_recording_id IS NOT NULL;
```

**Expected Result**: 100% thumbnail coverage (all meetings have thumbnails)

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING (10/10 meetings have thumbnails)

---

### Step 3: Verify Action Items (Critical Test)

#### 3A. Check Total Action Items

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_action_items,
  COUNT(DISTINCT meeting_id) as meetings_with_items
FROM meeting_action_items;
```

**Expected Result**:
- `total_action_items` > 2 (should be significantly more than the current 2)
- `meetings_with_items` > 1 (multiple meetings should have action items)

**Current Status**: Only 2 action items total (NEEDS IMPROVEMENT)

#### 3B. Check Specific Meetings

Check the two meetings with known action items in Fathom:

**Meeting 1**: https://fathom.video/share/BTPE7mwG8QtBsQwtPtX6PxeauX1C8bZf
- Expected: 2 action items

**Meeting 2**: https://fathom.video/share/QX4zNf5vPfVRMFi-m9yP2vnqDNzFeoZz
- Meeting ID: `340398c2-2c5b-4f5b-a67b-7dc66443c320`
- Expected: 3 action items

```sql
-- Check action items for specific meetings
SELECT
  m.id,
  m.title,
  m.share_url,
  mai.title as action_item_title,
  mai.timestamp_seconds,
  mai.ai_generated,
  mai.completed,
  mai.category
FROM meetings m
LEFT JOIN meeting_action_items mai ON mai.meeting_id = m.id
WHERE m.id IN (
  '340398c2-2c5b-4f5b-a67b-7dc66443c320',
  '2a6e6f7b-f1e7-4c1f-aa8e-29ffabc276ad'
)
ORDER BY m.meeting_start DESC, mai.timestamp_seconds;
```

**Expected Result**: Should see 3 action items for meeting `340398c2-2c5b-4f5b-a67b-7dc66443c320`

#### 3C. Check Frontend Display

Navigate to: http://localhost:5173/meetings/340398c2-2c5b-4f5b-a67b-7dc66443c320

**Expected Behavior**:
- 3 action items displayed in the UI
- Action items match those from Fathom
- Click on action items to verify playback URLs work

---

### Step 4: Verify No Duplicate Attendees

```sql
SELECT
  meeting_id,
  email,
  name,
  COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM meeting_attendees
WHERE email IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY meeting_id, email, name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**Expected Result**: 0 rows (no duplicates)

**Status**: ‚úÖ CONFIRMED WORKING (0 duplicate attendees found)

---

### Step 5: Verify Contact Creation

#### 5A. Check Total Fathom Contacts

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_fathom_contacts,
  COUNT(DISTINCT company_id) as unique_companies
FROM contacts
WHERE source = 'fathom_meeting';
```

**Expected Result**:
- `total_fathom_contacts` ‚â• 9 (we created 9 in the last sync)
- Should increase with each sync as new external participants are found

**Current Status**: 9 Fathom contacts created (up from 0)

#### 5B. Verify Contact Schema

Check that contacts have proper data:

```sql
SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  full_name,
  email,
  company_id,
  owner_id,
  source
FROM contacts
WHERE source = 'fathom_meeting'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Expected Result**:
- All contacts have `first_name`, `last_name` populated
- No `name` field errors
- All contacts have `owner_id` (not `user_id`)
- All contacts have valid `company_id`

---

### Step 6: Verify Activities Created

```sql
SELECT
  a.id,
  a.type,
  a.status,
  a.client_name,
  a.date,
  a.meeting_id,
  m.fathom_recording_id
FROM activities a
JOIN meetings m ON m.id = a.meeting_id
WHERE m.fathom_recording_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY a.date DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected Result**:
- Activities created for each Fathom meeting
- No `duration_minutes` errors in logs
- All activities have proper `user_id`, `meeting_id`, `contact_id`, `company_id`

---

### Step 7: Check Edge Function Logs

Check for any errors or warnings:

```bash
# In Supabase dashboard, check Edge Function logs for fathom-sync
# Look for:
# ‚úÖ "Successfully synced X meetings"
# ‚úÖ "Created new company: [Company Name]"
# ‚úÖ "Inserted action item: [Item Title]"
# ‚ùå NO schema errors (contacts.name, activities.duration_minutes, etc.)
# ‚ùå NO duplicate key violations
```

## üêõ Known Issues & Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: Missing Thumbnails ‚úÖ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Line 858 required `share_url` before generating placeholder
**Fix**: Removed conditional - always generate placeholder if no thumbnail
**Result**: 100% thumbnail coverage confirmed

### Issue 2: Action Items Not Syncing ‚úÖ FIXED (PENDING VERIFICATION)
**Root Cause**: Using wrong API endpoint `/recordings/{id}/action_items`
**Fix**: Changed to `/recordings/{id}` for full recording details
**Additional Fix**: Updated parsing logic for new API format
**Status**: Code deployed, awaiting test results

### Issue 3: Duplicate Attendees ‚úÖ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Creating entries in multiple tables for same person
**Fix**: Separated internal vs external participant logic
**Result**: 0 duplicates confirmed

### Issue 4: Contact Schema Errors ‚úÖ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Using `name` instead of `first_name/last_name`, `user_id` instead of `owner_id`
**Fix**: Updated all 3 files (fathom-sync, primaryContactSelection, companyMatching)
**Result**: 9 contacts created, awaiting more

### Issue 5: RLS Policies Blocking Display ‚úÖ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Conflicting RLS policies on meeting_action_items
**Fix**: Applied FIX_ACTION_ITEMS_RLS.sql
**Result**: Frontend can now display action items

### Issue 6: Activities Schema Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Root Cause**: Inserting non-existent `duration_minutes` field
**Fix**: Removed field from insert statement
**Result**: Deployed in v25, awaiting test

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### If Action Items Still Not Syncing:

1. **Check Fathom API Response**:
   - Verify the full recording details endpoint returns action items
   - Check if `action_items` field exists and is populated
   - Verify format matches our parsing logic

2. **Check Edge Function Logs**:
   - Look for "Fetching full recording details" messages
   - Check for "Found X action items" log entries
   - Look for any 404 or authentication errors

3. **Check Database**:
   - Verify action items are being inserted (check for insert errors)
   - Check RLS policies allow SELECT for current user
   - Verify meeting IDs match between tables

### If Contacts Still Have Errors:

1. **Check Schema**:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'contacts';
   ```

2. **Check Edge Function Logs**:
   - Look for "Created contact:" messages
   - Check for any duplicate email violations
   - Look for schema mismatch errors

### If Activities Have Errors:

1. **Check Schema**:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'activities';
   ```

2. **Verify Insert Fields**:
   - Ensure only valid columns are being inserted
   - Check for any NOT NULL constraint violations
