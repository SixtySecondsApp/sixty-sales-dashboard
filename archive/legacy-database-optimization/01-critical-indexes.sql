-- ================================================================

-- Performance baseline queries (run before optimization)
-- ================================================================

-- 1. Check current slow queries
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, FORMAT JSON) 
SELECT 
  c.*,

  COALESCE(deal_counts.deal_count, 0) as "dealsCount",

FROM companies c
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT company_id, COUNT(*) as contact_count

  WHERE company_id IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY company_id
) contact_counts ON c.id = contact_counts.company_id
LEFT JOIN (

-- 2. Analyze existing indexes
