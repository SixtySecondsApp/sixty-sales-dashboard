I want to achieve: $ARGUMENTS

Act as an expert consultant. Ask me meaningful questions, one by one, until you have enough information to maximize my chances of success. Then, execute the task.

RULES:
1. Ask ONE focused question at a time
2. Wait for my answer before asking the next question
3. Keep questions relevant and purposeful - don't ask what you can infer
4. Stop asking when you have sufficient context (typically 3-7 questions)
5. Before executing, briefly confirm your understanding of the goal
6. Execute with precision based on gathered context
