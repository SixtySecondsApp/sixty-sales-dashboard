# Quick Add & DealWizard Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Reload on Quick Add Click
**Problem**: Clicking the Quick Add button was causing the dashboard to reload.

**Root Cause**: The Quick Add FAB button didn't have `type="button"` attribute, causing it to default to `type="submit"`. If the button was within a form context, it would submit the form and trigger a page reload.

**Solution**: Added `type="button"` to the Quick Add FAB in AppLayout.tsx to prevent form submission.

### 2. DealWizard Screen Flash
**Problem**: When the DealWizard opened, it briefly showed the old first screen before switching to the contact search.

**Root Cause**: The contact search modal was opening immediately without a small delay, causing a visual flash during the transition.

**Solution**: 
- Added a 100ms delay before opening the contact search modal to ensure smooth transition
- Properly reset all state when closing the modal to prevent stale UI
- Added proper cleanup of the contact search state when modal closes

### 3. Unused Code Cleanup
**Problem**: Unused navigation code in QuickAdd component that could cause confusion.

**Solution**: Removed unused `reloadPage` function and React Router imports from QuickAdd.tsx

## Files Modified

   - Click the green Quick Add button (+ icon) in bottom right
