**Subject:** Anuncia Medical Partnership Proposal - Ready for Review

---

Hi Elsa,

Great speaking with you and the team over the past few weeks. As discussed, I've put together our proposal for the 12-month engagement to transform Anuncia's marketing foundation and operational efficiency.

**Quick Overview:**
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-6):** $7,500/month - Foundation building (brand refresh, website, PEDS video, content library)
- **Phase 2 (Months 7-12):** $5,000/month - Flexible objective-based support
- **Total Investment:** $75,000 over 12 months
- **Payment:** First month ($7,500) due upon signature, then monthly in advance

**Immediate Priority:** PEDS booth video delivered by December 4th for the Memphis conference.

The proposal includes everything we discussed:
- Complete brand refresh with comprehensive guidelines
- Modern website rebuild (away from WordPress)
- Video template library and product explainers
- Social media content system with compliance framework
- AI workflow automation for your manual processes
- Flexible support aligned with your evolving priorities

I've kept Phase 2 intentionally flexible so we can adapt to where the business is at months 7-12 (fundraising, EVD launch, international expansion, etc.). Each month we'll scope 2-4 key deliverables within the $5K budget.

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the proposal with Daryl and Stefan
2. Let me know if you have any questions or need modifications
3. Sign and return with first payment to kick things off
4. We'll schedule the kickoff call within 48 hours

I'm ready to move quickly once you're ready. Given the December 5th PEDS deadline, the sooner we can get started, the better.

Looking forward to partnering with you to bring Anuncia's mission to life through world-class marketing.

Best regards,
