## Statement of Work

### Introduction

**Anuncia Medical** is a neurotherapeutic device company developing breakthrough noninvasive solutions for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) management. Their flagship product, the **ReFlow™ Mini Flusher**, addresses a critical unmet need: shunt occlusions, the leading cause of repeat brain surgeries in hydrocephalus patients. With 100,000+ shunt procedures performed annually in the US and a 40% first-year failure rate, Anuncia's patient-controlled solution represents a paradigm shift—allowing families to manage blockages at home and potentially reducing revision surgeries by more than 50%.

Despite being commercial in 35 US hospitals with FDA Breakthrough Device Designation for their upcoming EVD product, Anuncia faces the classic medtech scaling challenge: a small, stretched team (10 people) managing everything from sales to regulatory to operations. Their website is outdated, their brand identity inconsistent, their video content limited, and their social media presence minimal. Meanwhile, manual processes—from order entry to VAC submissions—consume hours of valuable time that should be spent closing deals and serving patients.

With a critical fundraising round in progress ($2-4M) and major conference presentations ahead (PEDS Conference, December 2024), Anuncia needs to elevate their brand presence, automate operational workflows, and create scalable marketing assets—all while maintaining FDA compliance and supporting aggressive growth targets.

**Sixty Seconds** proposes a comprehensive 12-month engagement to transform Anuncia's marketing foundation, operational efficiency, and market presence through strategic branding, professional video content, modern web design, and AI-powered automation.

---

## Project Objectives

1. **Establish Brand Excellence** – Create a modern, consistent brand identity that positions Anuncia as the innovation leader in shunt management while preserving the meaningful snow leopard heritage and distinctive visual elements.

2. **Build Digital Foundation** – Design and launch a professional, SEO-optimized website that effectively communicates Anuncia's value proposition to neurosurgeons, hospitals, patients, and investors.

3. **Create Video Content Library** – Develop professional video assets including booth presentations, product explainers, KOL testimonials, and social media templates that can be used by the sales team and marketing coordinator.

4. **Enable Social Media Presence** – Provide pre-approved, compliant social media content templates and posting strategies that allow consistent brand presence without consuming internal resources.

5. **Automate Manual Workflows** – Implement AI-powered automation for order processing, CRM management, and other time-intensive manual processes that currently burden the commercial team.

6. **Support Strategic Objectives** – Provide flexible marketing and operational support aligned with evolving business priorities including fundraising, product launches, and market expansion.

## AI Workflow Development Methodology

When executing AI automation objectives (Month 7-12 selection), Sixty Seconds employs a proven methodology:

1. **Process Mapping** – Document current manual workflow with time tracking and pain point identification
2. **Automation Design** – Design AI-powered workflow with tools like n8n, Make, or Zapier integrated with ChatGPT, Claude, or specialized AI models
3. **Human-in-Loop Integration** – Build quality checkpoints ensuring human review where required (especially for FDA compliance)
4. **Testing & Refinement** – Pilot with sample data, refine based on edge cases, validate accuracy
5. **Training & Handoff** – Train Anuncia team on workflow usage, provide documentation, offer ongoing support
6. **Monitoring & Optimization** – Track time savings, error reduction, and user satisfaction; continuously improve

**Example: Order Processing Automation**
- Input: Purchase order received via email
- AI reads and extracts: customer name, product, quantity, shipping address, cost center
- AI populates: order form, shipping label, packing slip, invoice
- Human review: Quality manager verifies accuracy before final approval
- Output: Complete order package ready for fulfillment in <2 minutes (vs. 15 minutes manual)
