# Fathom Integration - Testing Checklist

Comprehensive testing checklist to verify all Fathom integration functionality works correctly.

## üìã Pre-Test Verification

### Database Setup
- [ ] All migrations deployed successfully
  ```sql
  -- Verify tables exist
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_name IN ('fathom_integrations', 'fathom_sync_state', 'fathom_oauth_states', 'meetings')
  ORDER BY table_name;
  ```
- [ ] Meetings table has Fathom columns:
  - `fathom_recording_id` (TEXT UNIQUE)
  - `fathom_user_id` (TEXT)
  - `last_synced_at` (TIMESTAMPTZ)
  - `sync_status` (TEXT)
- [ ] Cron jobs scheduled:
  ```sql
  SELECT jobname, schedule, active FROM cron.job
  WHERE jobname IN ('fathom-hourly-sync', 'cleanup-cron-logs');
  ```

### Edge Functions
- [ ] All 4 functions deployed:
  - `fathom-oauth-initiate`
  - `fathom-oauth-callback`
  - `fathom-sync`
  - `fathom-cron-sync`
- [ ] Functions appear in Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions

### Environment Configuration
- [ ] Environment secrets set:
  ```bash
  supabase secrets list
  ```
  - `VITE_FATHOM_CLIENT_ID`
  - `VITE_FATHOM_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - `VITE_FATHOM_REDIRECT_URI`
- [ ] Database settings configured:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    current_setting('app.supabase_url', true) as url,
    CASE WHEN current_setting('app.supabase_service_role_key', true) IS NULL
    THEN 'NOT SET' ELSE 'CONFIGURED' END as key_status;
  ```

## üîê Test 1: OAuth Connection Flow

### Test 1.1: Initial Connection
**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/integrations` page
2. Locate Fathom card (should show "Not Connected")
3. Click "Connect Fathom Account" button
4. OAuth popup window opens
5. Log in to Fathom (if not already logged in)
6. Authorize application
7. Popup closes automatically
8. Integration page refreshes

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] OAuth popup opens successfully
- [ ] Fathom login/authorization page loads
- [ ] After authorization, popup closes
- [ ] Success toast notification appears
- [ ] Fathom card shows "Connected" badge (green)
- [ ] User email displayed under "Connected As"
- [ ] Token expiration date shown
- [ ] Scopes displayed (should include `public_api`)

**Verify in Database:**
```sql
-- Check integration was created
SELECT
  id,
  user_id,
  fathom_user_email,
  is_active,
  token_expires_at,
  scopes
FROM fathom_integrations
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Check sync state initialized
SELECT
  sync_status,
  meetings_synced,
  total_meetings_found

2. Watch sync progress in real-time
3. Verify exactly 5 (or fewer) meetings imported

**Expected Results:**
- [ ] "Test Sync" button shows loading spinner
- [ ] Sync completes in < 10 seconds
