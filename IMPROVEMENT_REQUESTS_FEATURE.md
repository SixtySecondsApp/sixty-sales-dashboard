# 🚀 Improvement Requests Feature

I've successfully built a comprehensive improvement requests feature for your sales dashboard! This allows non-technical sales teams to suggest improvements and track them through a structured workflow.

## ✨ What I've Built

### 🗄️ Database Schema
- **New table**: `improvement_requests` with full relationship support
- **Kanban workflow**: Suggested → Planned → In Progress → Testing → Deployed
- **Priority levels**: Low, Medium, High, Urgent
- **Categories**: UI/UX, Feature, Bug Fix, Performance, Workflow, Reporting, Other
- **Impact & Effort estimation**: Business impact and development effort tracking
- **User relationships**: Request creators and assignees
- **Audit trail**: Timestamps for each status change
- **Row Level Security**: Proper access control policies

### 🎨 User Interface Components

#### 📋 List View (`ImprovementRequestList.tsx`)
- **Advanced filtering**: By status, priority, category, assignee
- **Search functionality**: Across titles, descriptions, and user names
- **Sorting options**: By date, title, priority, status, category
- **Responsive design**: Beautiful cards with all request details
- **Actions**: Edit and delete with confirmation dialogs

#### 📊 Kanban Board (`ImprovementRequestKanban.tsx`)
- **Drag & drop**: Move requests between workflow stages
- **Visual workflow**: 5 distinct columns with color coding
- **Real-time updates**: Automatic status timestamp tracking

### ⚙️ Technical Implementation

#### 🔗 Custom Hook (`useImprovementRequests.ts`)
- **CRUD operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Real-time queries**: React Query integration
- **Error handling**: Toast notifications for all operations
- **Filtering support**: Dynamic query building
- **Optimistic updates**: Smooth user experience

#### 📝 TypeScript Types (`improvementRequests.ts`)

- **Filter interfaces**: Search and filtering support

### 🧭 Navigation Integration
- **Added to main menu**: "Improvements" with mail icon
- **Route configuration**: `/improvements` path
- **App layout integration**: Consistent with existing pages

## 🚧 Setup Required

### 1. Database Migration
The database table needs to be created. You have two options:

#### Option A: Manual SQL Execution
Run this SQL directly in your Supabase dashboard:

```sql
-- The complete migration is in:
-- supabase/migrations/20250127130000_create_improvement_requests_table.sql
```

#### Option B: Configure Environment & Run Script
1. Set up your Supabase environment variables in `.env.local`:
```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
VITE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

2. Run the migration script:
```bash
node scripts/run-improvement-requests-migration.js
```

### 2. Access the Feature
Once the database is set up:
1. Start your application: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the new "Improvements" menu item
3. Start creating improvement requests!
