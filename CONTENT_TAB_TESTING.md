## 🔍 Database Verification

### Check Topic Extraction Record

```sql
-- View extracted topics for a meeting
SELECT
  id,
  meeting_id,
  extraction_version,
  jsonb_array_length(topics) as topic_count,
  model_used,
  tokens_used,
  cost_cents,
  created_at
FROM meeting_content_topics
WHERE meeting_id = 'your-meeting-id'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Check Generated Content Records

```sql
-- View all content generated for a meeting
SELECT
  id,
  meeting_id,
  content_type,
  title,
  version,
  is_latest,
  model_used,
  tokens_used,
  cost_cents,
  created_at
FROM meeting_generated_content
WHERE meeting_id = 'your-meeting-id'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL
ORDER BY content_type, version DESC;
```

### Check Cost Tracking

```sql
-- View cost tracking for current user
SELECT
  operation,
  cost_cents,
  meeting_id,
  created_at
FROM cost_tracking
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Calculate total spending today
SELECT
  SUM(cost_cents) as total_cost_cents,
  COUNT(*) as operation_count
FROM cost_tracking
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  AND DATE(created_at) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

## 🔧 Edge Function Testing

### Test extract-content-topics directly

```bash
# Get your access token from browser console:
# supabase.auth.getSession().then(({data}) => console.log(data.session.access_token))

curl -X POST \
  https://ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb.functions.supabase.co/extract-content-topics \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "meetingId": "your-meeting-id"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "topics": [
    {
      "title": "Product Demo",
      "description": "Discussion about new feature capabilities",
      "timestamp_seconds": 120,
      "fathom_url": "https://fathom.video/share/..."
    }
  ],
  "tokensUsed": 1234,
  "costCents": 4,
  "cached": false
}
```

### Test generate-marketing-content directly

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb.functions.supabase.co/generate-marketing-content \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "meetingId": "your-meeting-id",
    "topicIndices": [0, 1],
    "contentType": "social"
  }'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "content": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Product Launch Announcement",
    "content": "# Excited to share...",
    "contentType": "social",
    "version": 1
  },
  "tokensUsed": 5678,
  "costCents": 85
}
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Transcript Not Available" Message

**Cause**: Meeting doesn't have transcript_text populated
**Solution**:
```sql
-- Check if meeting has transcript
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  transcript_text IS NOT NULL as has_transcript,
  LENGTH(transcript_text) as transcript_length
FROM meetings
WHERE id = 'your-meeting-id';
```

If no transcript, either:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for Fathom to process
- Manually add test transcript for development

### Issue: Edge Function Returns 500 Error

**Causes & Solutions**:

1. **Missing Anthropic API Key**
   ```bash
   # Set in Supabase Dashboard > Project Settings > Edge Functions > Secrets
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

2. **Invalid Meeting ID**
   - Verify meeting exists and user has access
   - Check RLS policies allow reading meeting

3. **Insufficient Credits**
   - Check Anthropic account has available credits

### Issue: Topics Not Caching

**Cause**: Caching logic not working
**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check if topics were saved
SELECT COUNT(*) as topic_records
FROM meeting_content_topics
WHERE meeting_id = 'your-meeting-id'
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

If count = 0, check edge function logs for errors.

### Issue: Cost Not Being Tracked

**Cause**: cost_tracking table not receiving inserts
**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check if any cost records exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as cost_records
FROM cost_tracking
WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

If count = 0, check edge function is calling insert after operations.

### Issue: Permission Denied Errors

**Cause**: RLS policies preventing access
**Debug**:
```sql
-- Check meeting ownership
SELECT
  id,
  owner_user_id,
  auth.uid() as current_user,
  owner_user_id = auth.uid() as is_owner
FROM meetings
WHERE id = 'your-meeting-id';
```

If `is_owner = false`, user doesn't own the meeting.

## 📊 Performance Testing

### Test Concurrent Requests

```bash
# Run 5 topic extractions in parallel
for i in {1..5}; do
  curl -X POST \
    https://ewtuefzeogytgmsnkpmb.functions.supabase.co/extract-content-topics \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -H "apikey: YOUR_ANON_KEY" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"meetingId": "test-meeting-'$i'"}' &
done
wait
```

Verify:
- ✅ All requests complete successfully
- ✅ No timeout errors
- ✅ Costs tracked correctly for each request

### Test Large Transcripts

Create a meeting with a very long transcript (10,000+ words):
- Verify topic extraction completes within 30 seconds
- Verify costs are reasonable (not exceeding expected range)
- Verify generated content quality remains high
