    last_transcript_fetch_at IS NULL
    OR last_transcript_fetch_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'

-- Expected: Meetings that will be retried on next sync


-- =====================================================
-- INTERPRETATION GUIDE
-- =====================================================
--
-- HEALTHY IMPLEMENTATION INDICATORS:
-- ✅ All new columns exist in both tables (queries 1 & 2)
-- ✅ Recent meetings have transcript_text populated (query 3)
-- ✅ AI metrics (sentiment, talk_time) are being calculated (query 3)
-- ✅ AI-generated action items exist with confidence scores (queries 4 & 5)
-- ✅ Deduplication is working (more total items than duplicates) (query 6)
-- ✅ Retry logic is working (attempts incrementing, times tracked) (query 7)
--
-- ISSUES TO INVESTIGATE:
-- ❌ No transcripts after 15+ minutes → Check Fathom API
-- ❌ No AI metrics despite transcripts → Check Claude API key
-- ❌ All AI items need review → Check confidence threshold
-- ❌ Identical AI and Fathom items → Deduplication not working
-- ❌ Max retry attempts reached for recent meetings → Fathom processing delays
--
-- COST TRACKING:
-- - Count of AI analyses = meetings with sentiment_score
-- - Estimated cost = count × $0.01 per meeting
