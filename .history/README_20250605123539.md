## Database Setup

This application uses Supabase as its primary database and authentication provider. Make sure your Supabase project has the following tables set up:
- `profiles` - User profiles
- `companies` - Company records
- `contacts` - Contact information
- `deals` - Sales deals
- `deal_stages` - Pipeline stages
- `activities` - Sales activities

You can find the database schema in the `supabase/migrations/` directory.
