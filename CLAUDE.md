4. **Signed**: Contract executed (split deals created here)

**Migration Notes**: 
- Existing deals automatically migrated from 7+ legacy stages
- `stage_migration_notes` field tracks original stage information
- Foreign key constraints handled during migration process

### Proposal Workflow Rules
- **Stage Transition**: Moving deal to "Opportunity" triggers proposal confirmation
- **Modal Confirmation**: "Have you sent a proposal?" prevents accidental activities
- **Smart Activity Creation**: Proposal activity only created when user confirms "Yes"
- **Automated Follow-up**: 3-day follow-up task automatically generated
- **Workflow Prevention**: Eliminates unintentional proposal activity creation

### Admin Controls
- Only admins can create/edit revenue splits
- Only admins can access Smart Task template management at `/admin/smart-tasks`
- Split deals cannot be deleted by non-admins
- Non-admins can delete their own non-split deals
- All admin actions are logged for audit purposes
- Smart task creation triggers are admin-configurable

### Smart Task Automation Rules
