## üõ°Ô∏è Security Model

### Permission Levels
1. **Super Admin**: Full system access, user management, revenue splitting
2. **Admin**: Revenue splitting, advanced pipeline management
3. **Standard User**: Basic CRM functionality, own data management
4. **Read-Only**: View access only (future implementation)

### Data Protection
- **Split Deal Protection**: Non-admins cannot modify deals with revenue splits
- **Ownership Validation**: Users can only edit/delete their own non-split deals
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all data modifications
